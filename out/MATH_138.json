With this in mind, we will begin our course by introducing a convenient notation for sums. While this notation will eventually be adapted to sums of infinitely many real numbers (known as infinite series ), our focus for now will be on summing an arbitrary collection of finitely many real numbers. Discussions surrounding infinite series will be saved for Chapter 3. Definition 0.1.1 Sigma Notation Let \ud835\udc5a and \ud835\udc5b be integers with \ud835\udc5a \u2264\ud835\udc5b, and let \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+1, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+2, . . . , \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b be real numbers. We define \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+1 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b, which we refer to as a sum expressed in sigma notation. There are various components that comprise sigma notation. The symbol \u201c\u03a3\u201d is the capital Greek letter sigma, which indicates that addition is to occur.

In particular, addition can be performed in any order (commutativity) and multiplying a sum of terms by a constant is equivalent to multiplying each term by the constant and adding the results (distributivity). These properties are summarized below.

Section 0.1 Sigma Notation 7 The proof of (iii) is similar, or it can be established as a consequence of (i) and (ii). Example 0.1.4 If \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 = 3 and \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 = 2, then what is the value of \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 (4\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 \u2212\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56)? Solution: We have \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 (4\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 \u2212\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 4\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 (by Theorem 0.1.3 (iii)) = 4 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 (by Theorem 0.1.3 (i)) = 4(3) \u22122 = 10. Reindexing Sums There is not a unique way to represent a sum in sigma notation. For instance, both 4\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=2 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 1 and 8\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=6 1 2\ud835\udc56 \u22127 represent the sum 1 5 + 1 7 + 1 9 . In some cases when working with a sum in sigma notation, we may wish to rewrite the sum so that its index begins at a particular value \u2013 typically \ud835\udc56 = 0 or \ud835\udc56 = 1. This process is known as reindexing the sum. There are multiple methods to reindex a sum, which we will explore by rewriting the sum 4\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=2 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 1 = 1 5 + 1 7 + 1 9 to begin at \ud835\udc56 = 0. Method 1: Add and subtract terms If, in the sum above, we were to simply change the starting index from \ud835\udc56 = 2 to \ud835\udc56 = 0 with no other adjustments, we would obtain 4\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 1 = 1 + 1 3 + 1 5 + 1 7 + 1 9 which, of course, is different from the sum we started with. Specifically, this new sum includes two extra terms: 1 (coming from \ud835\udc56 = 0) and 1 3 (coming from \ud835\udc56 = 1). To make up for the addition of these two new terms, we can subtract 1 and 1 3 as follows: 4\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=2 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 1 = 4\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 1 \u22121 \u22121 3 = \u22124 3 + 4\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 1. 8 Chapter 0 Pre-Calculus Review As desired, we have converted our sum to start from index \ud835\udc56 = 0. A single constant term, namely \u22124 3 , has also been introduced as part of this conversion and is separate from the rest",

A single constant term, namely \u22124 3 , has also been introduced as part of this conversion and is separate from the rest of the sum in sigma notation.

Solution: We have 10\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=3 \ud835\udc562 = 10\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 \ud835\udc562 \u221202 \u221212 \u221222 \u23df \u23de subtract newly added terms = \u22125 + 10\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 \ud835\udc562. REMARK Our first method for reindexing a sum becomes impractical when shifting the index by a large amount. For example, if we were to use this method to reindex the sum 200\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=100 1\u221a \ud835\udc56 = 1\u221a 100 + 1\u221a 101 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1\u221a 200 to start at \ud835\udc56 = 1, we would need to add and subtract the terms obtained by setting \ud835\udc56 = 1, \ud835\udc56 = 2, and so on all the way through to \ud835\udc56 = 99. That is, 200\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=100 1\u221a \ud835\udc56 = 100\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 1\u221a \ud835\udc56 \u2212 (\ufe02 1 + 1\u221a 2 + 1\u221a 3 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1\u221a 99 )\ufe02 and, unfortunately, there is no way to nicely simplify the terms 1 + 1\u221a 2 + 1\u221a 3 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1\u221a 99 other than by brute force computation with the aid of a calculator. Method 2: Adjust the index within the sum itself Consider once again the sum 4\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=2 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 1 = 1 5 + 1 7 + 1 9. To reindex the sum from starting at \ud835\udc56 = 2 to \ud835\udc56 = 0, we will decrease both the starting and ending values of the index by 2. In order to offset the effect this change has on our sum, we will increase the values of the index within the sum by 2. That is, we will replace each \ud835\udc56 inside the sum with \ud835\udc56 + 2. These changes together give us the following: Section 0.1 Sigma Notation 9 4\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=2 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 1 = 2\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 1 2(\ud835\udc56 + 2) + 1 = 2\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 5. Decrease by 2 Decrease by 2 Replace \ud835\udc56 with \ud835\udc56 + 2 One may verify that the sum itself is unchanged by this process. Indeed, 2\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 1 2\ud835\udc56 + 5 = 1 2(0) + 5 + 1 2(1) + 5 + 1 2(2) + 5 = 1 5 + 1 7 + 1 9.

REMARK Unlike with the first method for reindexing, this second method does not introduce an additional constant separate from the rest of the sum in sigma notation. The second method also allows one to reindex a sum by a large amount without having to deal with extra terms. Example 0.1.6 Reindex the sum 200\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=100 1\u221a \ud835\udc56 to start at \ud835\udc56 = 1. Solution: As mentioned in the remark following Example 0.1.5, reindexing this sum by adding and subtracting terms will introduce lots of extra numbers for us to deal with. Instead, we will use the second method: adjusting the index within the sum itself. By subtracting 99 from the starting and ending values of the index and counteracting this change by replacing each \ud835\udc56 within the sum with \ud835\udc56 + 99, we obtain 200\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=100 1\u221a \ud835\udc56 = 101\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 1\u221a\ud835\udc56 + 99. 10 Chapter 0 Pre-Calculus Review 0.2 Completing the Square A quadratic polynomial, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc50, can be rewritten in the form \ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\u210e)2 + \ud835\udc58 through a process known as completing the square . For instance, 2 \ud835\udc652 \u221216\ud835\udc65 + 33 can be written as 2(\ud835\udc65 \u22124)2 + 1. These two expressions are equivalent, but the latter is sometimes easier to work with. Let us refresh your memory of the completing the square process via an example. Consider the quadratic polynomial \ud835\udc652 + 6\ud835\udc65 + 5. To complete the square, we begin by adding and subtracting certain constant (represented below by a blank box) that will make part of the quadratic recognizable as a perfect square; hence the name \u201ccompleting the square\u201d! (\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 + 6\ud835\udc65 + )\ufe00 + 5 \u2212 . The constant that we introduce is obtained by dividing the coefficient of the \ud835\udc65-term by 2 and then squaring the result. In our example, that coefficient is 6. We divide 6 by 2 to get 3, which we then square to obtain 9. Replacing the blank box above with 9, we obtain (\ud835\udc652 + 6\ud835\udc65 + 9) \u22124. The bracketed term can now be factored as a perfect square. Indeed, we have \ud835\udc652 + 6\ud835\udc65 + 5 = (\ud835\udc652 + 6\ud835\udc65 + 9) \u22124 = (\ud835\udc65 + 3)2 \u22124. Note that the 3 in the completed square can be obtained by dividing 6 (i.e., the coefficient of \ud835\udc65) by 2. The bracketed term will always end up factoring in this way. Example 0.2.1 Rewrite \ud835\udc652 \u22122\ud835\udc65 + 9 by completing the square. Solution: The coefficient of \ud835\udc65 is \u22122. We divide this value by 2",

Example 0.2.1 Rewrite \ud835\udc652 \u22122\ud835\udc65 + 9 by completing the square. Solution: The coefficient of \ud835\udc65 is \u22122. We divide this value by 2 and square the result to get 1, which is what we add to and subtract from the quadratic. We obtain \ud835\udc652 \u22122\ud835\udc65 + 9 = (\ud835\udc652 \u22122\ud835\udc65 + 1) + 9\u22121 = (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)2 + 8. When working with a quadratic of the form \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc652 +\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc50 where \ud835\udc4e \u0338= 1, there is one additional step that must be carried out when completing the square. Specifically, we must first factor \ud835\udc4e from all of the terms involving \ud835\udc65 before proceeding with our usual process. For example, consider the quadratic polynomial 2\ud835\udc652 \u221216\ud835\udc65 + 33. Factoring the coefficient of \ud835\udc4e = 2 from all of the terms involving \ud835\udc65, we obtain 2(\ud835\udc652 \u22128\ud835\udc65) + 33. Within the brackets, the coefficient of \ud835\udc65 is \u22128. We divide this value by 2 and square the result to get 16, which we then add within the brackets to create a perfect square. Notice Section 0.2 Completing the Square 11 that we are actually adding a total of 2 \u00b716 = 32 to our polynomial given the factor of 2 in front of the bracketed term. Thus, we must subtract 32 outside of the brackets to make up for this addition. We obtain 2(\ud835\udc652 \u22128\ud835\udc65 + 16) + 33\u221232. The bracketed term now factors as (\ud835\udc65 \u22124)2, where \u22124 can be obtained by dividing \u22128 (i.e., the coefficient of \ud835\udc65 within the brackets) by 2. Thus, 2\ud835\udc652 \u221216\ud835\udc65 + 33 = 2(\ud835\udc652 \u22128\ud835\udc65 + 16) + 33\u221232 = 2(\ud835\udc65 \u22124)2 + 1. Example 0.2.2 Rewrite 3\ud835\udc652 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u22121 by completing the square. Solution: Factoring 3 from all terms involving \ud835\udc65, we have 3\ud835\udc652 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u22121 = 3(\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65) \u22121. The coefficient of \ud835\udc65 within the brackets is 1, which we divide by 2 and square to get 1 4 . Adding 1 4 within the brackets and subtracting 3 \u00b71 4 outside the brackets to make up for this addition, we obtain 3\ud835\udc652 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u22121 = 3 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 1 4 )\ufe02 \u22121 \u22123 4. The bracketed term now factors as a perfect square: 3\ud835\udc652 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u22121 = 3 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc65 + 1 2 )\ufe022 \u22127 4.

Chapter 1 Integration In your first course in calculus, you studied the derivative of a function \ud835\udc53. You were likely motivated by the problem of calculating the slope of a tangent line, but quickly learned that derivatives can be used for much more, such as approximating roots of functions, curve sketching, and optimization. In this chapter, we will explore the other side of the calculus coin: integral calculus! Our motivation will be to compute the area between the graph of a function and the \ud835\udc65-axis over an interval [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], which will lead us to the definition of the definite integral. Integrals, however, are useful for much more than just area calculations. They can be used to calculate volumes of 3D solids; the work done in applying force to an object over some distance; probabilities and expected values; forces and stresses on structures; fluid flow and heat transfer; and much more. Integrals are pivotal to the fields of Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. While integrals and derivatives may seems like completely separate concepts with unrelated motivations, these two branches of calculus turn out to be intimately linked. The connection is made precise in a result known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which we will explore in the sections to come. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to \u2022 state the definition of the definite integral and evaluate simple integrals by definition; \u2022 state and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate definite integrals; \u2022 recognize when and how to employ various integration techniques; \u2022 apply the tools of integral calculus to calculate areas and volumes. 1.1 The Definite Integral 1.1.1 Area Under a Curve In this section we will motivate the study of integral calculus through the problem of finding the area under the graph of a function. 12 Section 1.1 The Definite Integral 13 Given a continuous function \ud835\udc53 that is non-negative on [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] (that is, \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2265 0 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]), consider the region \ud835\udc46 that lies under the graph of the function, above the \ud835\udc65-axis, and between the vertical lines \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f. \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 If the function \ud835\udc53 is simple enough, we can use known geometric formulas to calculate the area of \ud835\udc46.

Con- sider, for example, the problem of calculating the area of the region \ud835\udc46 that lies under the graph of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 and above the \ud835\udc65-axis from \ud835\udc65 = 0 to \ud835\udc65 = 1. 1 1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) =\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 While we may not yet possess the tools to calculate this area exactly, we can certainly make some estimates. A crude estimate can be made by noting that \ud835\udc46 lies within a 1 \u00d71 square, and so 0 \u2264Area(\ud835\udc46) \u22641. This estimate, however, is not very precise. To improve it, we will divide the region into strips and estimate the area of each strip by relating it to the area of a simpler shape: a rectangle! For instance, we can divide the region into \ud835\udc5b = 4 strips by breaking up [0 , 1] into 4 subin- tervals, each with width \u2206 \ud835\udc65 = 1 4 : [0, 1] = [\ufe02 0, 1 4 ]\ufe02 \u222a [\ufe021 4, 1 2 ]\ufe02 \u222a [\ufe021 2, 3 4 ]\ufe02 \u222a [\ufe023 4, 1 ]\ufe02 . Let \ud835\udc461, \ud835\udc462, \ud835\udc463, and \ud835\udc464 denote the strips that make up the region under the graph as shown below (left). The area of each strip can be approximated by the area of a rectangle whose width is \u2206\ud835\udc65 = 1 4 and whose height is given by the value of the function \ud835\udc53. Since the value of \ud835\udc53 varies across throughout each subinterval, we will choose a sample point from each subinterval to plug into \ud835\udc53 to use as the height of each rectangle. For convenience, let us use the right endpoint of each subinterval to determine the height. This can be seen in the figure below (right).

Consequently, \ud835\udc454 is an overestimate of the area of \ud835\udc46: Area(\ud835\udc46) \u22640.46875. Note that the decision to use the value of the function right endpoints to specify the height of each rectangle was somewhat arbitrary.

To determine the exact area of this region, let\u2019s consider what happens to our approxima- tions as the number of rectangles, \ud835\udc5b, approaches infinity! If we partition [0 , 1] into \ud835\udc5b subintervals of equal width, the width of each subinterval will be \u2206\ud835\udc65 = length of [0, 1] \ud835\udc5b = 1 \u22120 \ud835\udc5b = 1 \ud835\udc5b.

We may simplify our expression for \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5b above by using a known formula for the sum of the first \ud835\udc5b perfect squares: \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc562 = 12 + 22 + 32 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc5b2 = \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b + 1)(2\ud835\udc5b + 1) 6 .

The above formula can be proved using induction, but that is not our focus here. We will simply apply the formula to continue our calculation of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5b: \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5b = 1 \ud835\udc5b3 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc562 = 1 \ud835\udc5b3 \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b + 1)(2\ud835\udc5b + 1) 6 = (\ud835\udc5b + 1)(2\ud835\udc5b + 1) 6\ud835\udc5b2 .

This time, in addition to requiring a formula for the sum of the first \ud835\udc5b perfect squares, we also require formulas for two other sums.

Such limits arise in various applications throughout mathematics. Some of these applications will be explored in the coming sections, while others may be studied in later courses. 20 Chapter 1 Integration Our immediate goal is to formalize and generalize the many new ideas explored in Sec- tion 1.1.1. In particular, we will generalize the method for calculating the area between the graph of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 and the \ud835\udc65-axis for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, 1] to apply to more general functions \ud835\udc53 over arbitrary intervals [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. In particular, we will no longer require that \ud835\udc53 be non-negative as in Section 1.1.1. Let \ud835\udc53 be a function that is defined on an interval [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] with \ud835\udc4e < \ud835\udc4f, and consider the region between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and the \ud835\udc65-axis for \ud835\udc65 from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f. \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 For every positive integer \ud835\udc5b, we can separate [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] into \ud835\udc5b",

These are known as irregular partitions and are considered in many calculus texts. Note, however, that in MATH 138, we will mainly be working with functions \ud835\udc53 that are either (a) continuous or (b) bounded with at most finitely many discontinuities. For such functions, it turns out to be sufficient to focus only on regular partitions of [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. Doing this will lead to an easier treatment of some of the mathematical theory that follows. While we will therefore not focus on irregular partitions in this exposition, we will say a few more words about them in the remark following Definition 1.1.3. By dividing [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] into subintervals, the region between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and the \ud835\udc65-axis is, in turn, divided into strips. \ud835\udc53 \u2206\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65* 1 \ud835\udc65* 2 \ud835\udc65* 3 \ud835\udc65* 4 \ud835\udc65* 5 \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 \ud835\udc651 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc653 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc655 = \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 Each strip can be approximated by a rectangle with width",

By dividing [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] into subintervals, the region between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and the \ud835\udc65-axis is, in turn, divided into strips. \ud835\udc53 \u2206\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65* 1 \ud835\udc65* 2 \ud835\udc65* 3 \ud835\udc65* 4 \ud835\udc65* 5 \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 \ud835\udc651 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc653 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc655 = \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 Each strip can be approximated by a rectangle with width \u2206\ud835\udc65 and height \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 ), where \ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 is a sample point chosen from the\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e subinterval, [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56]. The area of the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e rectangle is then \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 )\u2206\ud835\udc65, and hence the area between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and the \ud835\udc65-axis can be approximated by summing these areas for \ud835\udc56 from 1 to \ud835\udc5b. Such an approximation is called a Riemann sum. Definition 1.1.2 Riemann Sum Let \ud835\udc53 be a function defined on [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. Given a positive integer \ud835\udc5b, consider the regular partition \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 < \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4f. A Riemann sum of \ud835\udc53 with respect to this partition is an expression of the form \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 )\u2206\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* 1)\u2206\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* 2)\u2206\ud835\udc65 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc5b)\u2206\ud835\udc65, where \ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 is a sample point from [ \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56] for each \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, . . . , \ud835\udc5b. 22 Chapter 1 Integration REMARK If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 ) is negative, note that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 )\u2206\ud835\udc65 will then also be negative. In this case, \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 )\u2206\ud835\udc65 really represents the negative of the area the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e rectangle. In reality, the Riemann sums approximate what we refer to as a signed area. That is, they approximate the net area between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and the \ud835\udc65-axis with area above the \ud835\udc65-axis considered to be positive and area below the \ud835\udc65-axis considered to be negative. We will revisit the notion of a signed area in Section 1.2.1. To improve the accuracy of the Riemann sum approximations, we can consider the behaviour of the approximations as the number of subintervals, \ud835\udc5b, tends to infinity. This leads us to the following definition. Definition 1.1.3 The Definite Integral, Integrability Let \ud835\udc53 be a function defined on [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. For each positive integer \ud835\udc5b, consider the regular partition \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 < \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4f of [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] into subintervals of width \u2206\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b , so \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc56\u2206\ud835\udc65. For each \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, . . . , \ud835\udc5b, let \ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 be a sample point in the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e subinterval, [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56]. The definite integral of \ud835\udc53 from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f is the limit of Riemann sums \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 )\u2206\ud835\udc65, provided",

REMARK As mentioned in the remark following Definition 1.1.1, many calculus texts also consider irregular partitions of [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] when approximating the area under a curve. When considering both regular and irregular partitions in the definition of the definite integral, one must insist that maximum width of the subintervals in the partition approaches 0 in order to guarantee that all of the rectangles used to approximate the area become thin. In our case, since we are working only with partitions of equal width, insisting that the width of the subinterval approaches 0 is the same as insisting that the number of subintervals, \ud835\udc5b, approaches infinity. There are various pieces that make up the notation \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 for the definite integral.

It is based on an elongated \u201cS\u201d for summa, the Latin word for sum. It is a reminder that the integral, in some sense, represents an infinite sum of (signed) rectangle areas, with each rectangle having height \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and infinitesimally small width \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

One such function is presented in Example 1.1.8. While it is not the case that all functions are integrable, it is true that all continuous func- tions and are integrable. In fact, bounded functions with a finite number of discontinuities are also integrable. The proofs of these facts are beyond the scope of this exposition. Theorem 1.1.4 (Continuous Functions are Integrable) If \ud835\udc53 is continuous on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], then \ud835\udc53 is integrable on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. More generally, if \ud835\udc53 is bounded on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] and has only finitely many discontinuities, then \ud835\udc53 is integrable on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. The majority of functions we will be working with in this exposition are of the form described in Theorem 1.1.4: continuous, or bounded with only finitely many discontinuities. Hence, since such functions \ud835\udc53 are integrable, it does not matter which sample points \ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 \u2208[\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56] we use to compute the integral, \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 )\u2206\ud835\udc65; all choices of sample points produce the same limit! We are therefore free to choose each \ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 to be any point in [ \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56] that we deem to be convenient.

In a moment, we will use the formulas above to (finally!) compute some definite integrals; but first, let us close out this portion of our discussion by investigating an example of a bounded function \ud835\udc53 that is non-integrable. In light of Theorem 1.1.4, such a function must have infinitely many discontinuities! Example 1.1.8 Consider the function \ud835\udc53 on [0, 1] given by \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = {\ufe02 1 if \ud835\udc65 is rational, 0 if \ud835\udc65 is irrational. This function is not integrable on [0, 1]. Proof: Partition [0, 1] into \ud835\udc5b subintervals of equal width \u2206\ud835\udc65, and let 0 = \ud835\udc650 < \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = 1 denote the endpoints of these intervals. Crucially, note that each interval [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56] contains both rational numbers and irrational numbers. We will use this fact to show that the limit of Riemann sums depends on the sample points we choose, thereby showing that \ud835\udc53 is not integrable. First, consider the Riemann sums obtained by selecting a rational sample point \ud835\udc65(1) \ud835\udc56 from each interval [ \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56]. In this case, \ud835\udc53 (\ufe01 \ud835\udc65(1) \ud835\udc56 )\ufe01 = 1, and hence the limit of such Riemann sums is lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53 (\ufe01 \ud835\udc65(1) \ud835\udc56 )\ufe01 \u2206\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \u2206\ud835\udc65 \u23df \u23de length of [0,1] = 1 . Consider now the Riemann sums obtained by selecting irrational sample points \ud835\udc65(2) \ud835\udc56 from each interval [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56]. We have \ud835\udc53 (\ufe01 \ud835\udc65(2) \ud835\udc56 )\ufe01 = 0, and hence the limit of such Riemann sums is lim",

We actually carried out such a computation already in Section 1.1.1. Indeed, we showed that the area between the graph of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 and the \ud835\udc65-axis from \ud835\udc65 = 0 to \ud835\udc65 = 1 was exactly equal to 1 3 by considering the limits of right-endpoint and left-endpoint Riemann sums. Having since introduced the concept of an integral in Section 1.1.2, we can now state that \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 3. In the computation of \u222b\ufe001 0 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 in Section 1.1.1, we required certain sum formulas to simplify the Riemann sums before calculating the limit as \ud835\udc5b approaches infinity. These sum formulas will also be used in the examples that follow, and so we record them below for later reference. Some Useful Summation Formulas \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1\u23df \u23de \ud835\udc5b times = \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc56 = 1 + 2 + 3 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b + 1) 2 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc562 = 1 2 + 22 + 32 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc5b2 = \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b + 1)(2\ud835\udc5b + 1) 6 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc563 = 1 3 + 23 + 33 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc5b3 = \ud835\udc5b2(\ud835\udc5b + 1)2 4 The formulas above are useful for computing \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 when \ud835\udc53 is a linear, quadratic, or cubic polynomial. Calculating integrals of more complicated functions will require more advanced methods, which we will learn in the sections to come.

Proof: Properties (i) and (ii): These follow from the limit laws for sequences. Property (iii): Consider a regular partition of [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] into \ud835\udc5b subintervals with endpoints \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 < \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4f. Consider as well the corresponding right-endpoint Riemann sums \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)\u2206\ud835\udc65. 32 Chapter 1 Integration Since \ud835\udc5a \u2264\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2264\ud835\udc40 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], it follows that \ud835\udc5a \u2264\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) \u2264\ud835\udc40 for all \ud835\udc56. As a result, \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc5a\u2206\ud835\udc65 \u2264 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)\u2206\ud835\udc65 \u2264 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc40\u2206\ud835\udc65 (*) Since the partition is regular, we have \u2206 \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b and hence \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc5a\u2206\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e). Similarly, \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc40\u2206\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e). It then follows from ( *) that \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e) \u2264 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)\u2206\ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e). Taking the limit as \ud835\udc5b approaches infinity in all parts of the inequality, we obtain \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e) \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e). Property (iv): This is a consequence of Property (iii) where \ud835\udc5a = 0. Property (v): If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2264\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65), then \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u22650. Hence, 0 \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 (by (iv)) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 (by (i) and (ii)) Adding \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 to both sides of the inequality, we have \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, as desired. Property (vi): The mathematical tools required to show that |\ud835\udc53|is integrable are beyond those we have developed in this exposition, so we will simply accept this as fact. To prove the inequality \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, first observe that \u2212|\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2264|\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|for all \ud835\udc65. Hence, applying properties (v) and (i), we have \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, from which the result follows. Section 1.2 Properties of the Definite Integral 33 REMARK Property (iii) of Theorem 1.2.1 can be seen geometrically in terms of areas. Indeed, if \ud835\udc5a \u2264\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2264\ud835\udc40 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], then the graph of \ud835\udc53 lies above the line \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc5a and below the line \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc40. The area between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and the \ud835\udc65-axis for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] is at least as large as the area of the rectangle between the line \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc5a and the \ud835\udc65-axis. This rectangle is hatched in the image below and has area \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e). Thus, we obtain the inequality \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e) \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc5a\u2264\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\u2264\ud835\udc40, \u2200\ud835\udc65\u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 Similarly, the area between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and the \ud835\udc65-axis for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e,",

If we think of the integral as representing the area under the graph of \ud835\udc53 from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, then the region we are considering is infinitely thin and hence should have zero area. Therefore, we simply define this integral to have value 0. Definition 1.2.2 \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 If \ud835\udc53 is defined at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, we define \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 0. Given an integrable function \ud835\udc53, we may also encounter situations in which we must make sense of an integral of the form \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 where \ud835\udc4e < \ud835\udc4f. That is, an integral in which the lower limit of integration is greater than the upper limit. To decide how this expression should be defined, let us return to the definition of \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 from Section 1.1. If we consider the regular partitions of [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] and regard \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 as a limit of right-endpoint Riemann sums, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)\u2206\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b . If this definition were to directly extend to integrals of the form \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, we would have \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc5b = \u2212lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b = \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Thus, to be consistent with our existing definition for \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, we define \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 as follows: Definition 1.2.3 \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc4e < \ud835\udc4f If \ud835\udc53 is integrable on an interval [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], we define \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

We now will explore one additional property that explains how integrals can be broken up over the domain of integration, [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. This property is useful in various circumstances, as we will see in the coming sections. Section 1.2 Properties of the Definite Integral 35 Theorem 1.2.4 (Separating the Domain of Integration) If \ud835\udc53 is integrable on an interval \ud835\udc3c containing \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, and \ud835\udc50, then \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. While Theorem 1.2.4 can be proven using the definition of the definite integral, it is easier to think about this result in terms of areas. Indeed, if \ud835\udc4e < \ud835\udc50 < \ud835\udc4f, then Theorem 1.2.4 can be understood as follows: the area under the graph of \ud835\udc53 from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f is the same as the area under the graph from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc50 plus the area under the graph from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc50 to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f. \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc53 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 It is worth noting that Theorem 1.2.4 is true even when \ud835\udc50 is not between \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f. For instance, suppose that \ud835\udc4e < \ud835\udc4f < \ud835\udc50. In this case, as shown in the figure below, the area under the graph of \ud835\udc53 from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f is equal to the area from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc50 minus the area under the graph from \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc50: \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc53 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 36 Chapter 1 Integration We can represent this difference of areas with the equation \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

That is, the signed area between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and the \ud835\udc65-axis is 0. Hence, when \ud835\udc53 is an odd function, \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 0. If instead \ud835\udc53 is a bounded even function defined on [\u2212\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e], then the graph of \ud835\udc53 is symmetric about the \ud835\udc66-axis. In this case, the signed area for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\u2212\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e] is exactly double the signed area for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, \ud835\udc4e].

Solution: Using the definition of the definite integral would be completely impractical in this example since the integrand, \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 sin(\ud835\udc65) 1+\ud835\udc658 , is far too complicated. Instead, observe that \ud835\udc53 is odd. Indeed, \ud835\udc53(\u2212\ud835\udc65) = (\u2212\ud835\udc65)2 sin(\u2212\ud835\udc65) 1 + (\u2212\ud835\udc65)8 = \ud835\udc652 sin(\u2212\ud835\udc65) 1 + \ud835\udc658 = \u2212\ud835\udc652 sin(\ud835\udc65) 1 + \ud835\udc658 (since sin(\ud835\udc65) is odd) = \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). Since we are integrating an odd function over a symmetric domain [ \u2212\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b], we have \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b \u2212\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc652 sin(\ud835\udc65) 1 + \ud835\udc658 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 0. REMARK The condition that \ud835\udc53 be bounded in Theorem 1.2.5 is included to avoid the possibility of vertical asymptotes. Integrals of functions with vertical asymptotes will be addressed in Section 1.10. Section 1.2 Problems 1.2.1. Suppose \ud835\udc53, \ud835\udc54, and \u210e are integrable on [1, 6] such that \u222b\ufe01 6 1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= 7, \u222b\ufe01 6 1 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = 2, \u222b\ufe01 4 1 \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 5, and \u222b\ufe01 6 1 \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 3.

Given that \u222b\ufe01 2 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 6, \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 4 and \u222b\ufe01 2 1 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 9, evaluate the following: Section 1.2 Properties of the Definite Integral 39 (a) \u222b\ufe01 2 \u22122 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 (b) \u222b\ufe01 3 \u22123 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 (c) \u222b\ufe01 2 \u22121 (\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 1.2.3.

The tools we develop here will play an important role in proving a major result in the next section: the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus! Let us first recall the usual process for averaging finitely many real numbers. Specifically, the average of numbers \ud835\udc661, \ud835\udc662, . . . , \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b is calculated by adding all the \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2019s and dividing by \ud835\udc5b, the number of terms summed. That is, \ud835\udc66avg = \ud835\udc661 + \ud835\udc662 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b . Suppose now we wish to calculate the average of all \ud835\udc66-values attained by a continuous function \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. The above approach for calculating an average breaks down quite quickly, since we would now need to sum infinitely many \ud835\udc66-values. Fortunately, there is a workaround! First, partition [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] into subintervals of equal width, say [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] = [\ud835\udc650, \ud835\udc651] \u222a[\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652] \u222a\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u222a [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b], where \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 < \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4f. If \ud835\udc5b subintervals are used, the common width of these intervals is \u2206\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b . Next, select a sample point, \ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 , from each subinterval. The corresponding \ud835\udc66-values, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 ), provide a representative sample of the values attained by \ud835\udc53 throughout [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. \ud835\udc53 \u2206\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65* 1 \ud835\udc65* 2 \ud835\udc65* 3 \ud835\udc65* 4 \ud835\udc65* 5 \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 \ud835\udc651 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc653 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc655 = \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 Averaging these sample \ud835\udc66-values, we obtain a sort of approximate average of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65): \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* 1) + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* 2) + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc5b) \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 ) 1 \ud835\udc5b. To obtain a better representation of the values \ud835\udc53 attains throughout [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] \u2013 and hence a better approximation of the average of \ud835\udc53 \u2013 we can consider sampling points \ud835\udc65* \ud835\udc56 across a greater number of subintervals. Section 1.3 Average Value of a Function 41 Ultimately, we may ask what happens to these approximations as the number of subintervals approaches infinity. In this case, the approximations would approach a value lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e",

We define this integral to be the average value of \ud835\udc53 throughout [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]! Definition 1.3.1 Average Value of a Continuous Function If \ud835\udc53 is continuous on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], then the average value of \ud835\udc53 on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] is \ud835\udc53avg = 1 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Geometrically, we can interpret the average value of \ud835\udc53 as follows: for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], there is the same amount of area below the graph of \ud835\udc53 and above the horizontal line \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53avg as there is above the graph of \ud835\udc53 and below the horizontal line \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53avg. Referring to the figure below, this means that area \ud835\udc341 plus the area \ud835\udc343 is equal to the area \ud835\udc342. \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc53avg \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc341 \ud835\udc342 \ud835\udc343 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 42 Chapter 1 Integration Let\u2019s now see a concrete example of computing an average value!

It was shown in Example 1.1.9 that \u222b\ufe01 4 1 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= 15, hence, \ud835\udc53avg = 1 4 \u22121 \u222b\ufe01 4 1 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= 1 3(15) = 5.

The area under the graph of \ud835\udc53 and above the graph of the line \ud835\udc66 = 5 is the same as the area above the graph of \ud835\udc53 and below the line \ud835\udc66 = 5. \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc53avg = 5 1 4 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 Example 1.3.3 Determine the average value of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 4\ud835\udc653 \u2212\ud835\udc65 for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, 2].

Sure enough, \ud835\udc65 = 2.5 lies within [1 , 4], the interval over which the average was computed. It turns out this will always be the case: a continuous function will attain its average value somewhere in [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. This is known as the Average Value Theorem. Theorem 1.3.4 (The Average Value Theorem (AVT)) If \ud835\udc53 is continuous on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], then there exists at least one \ud835\udc50 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc50) = 1 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Proof: Since \ud835\udc53 is continuous on [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], then \ud835\udc53 attains maximum and minimum values on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] by the Extreme Value Theorem. That is, there exist real numbers \ud835\udc5a and \ud835\udc40 such that \ud835\udc5a \u2264\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2264\ud835\udc40 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208 [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], where \ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc501) and \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc502) for some \ud835\udc501, \ud835\udc502 \u2208 [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. Thus, by Theorem 1.2.1 (iii), \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e) \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e). Dividing by \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e, we have \ud835\udc5a \u2264 1 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc40, 44 Chapter 1 Integration and since \ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc501) and \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc502), it follows that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc501) \u2264 1 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc502). Finally, since \ud835\udc53 is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists some \ud835\udc50 between \ud835\udc501 and \ud835\udc502 (and hence between \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f) such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc50) = 1 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, as desired. REMARK It turns out that the Average Value Theorem has a direct connection to the Mean Value Theorem from Calculus I. As such, the Average Value Theorem is sometimes referred to as the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals. We will need to develop a bit more theory before we are able to make this connection precise.

If you would like to know more, see the remark at the end of Section 1.4. The Average Value Theorem plays a vital role in the proof of a major result in mathematics known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which we will explore in the next section. For now, let us wrap up our discussion with a quick example using the Average Value Theorem. Example 1.3.5 Let \ud835\udc53 be continuous on the interval [2 , 5] and suppose that \u222b\ufe01 5 2 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 12. Show that there exists some \ud835\udc50 \u2208[2, 5] such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc50) = 4. Solution: Since \ud835\udc53 is continuous on [2 , 5], the Average Value Theorem states that there exists some \ud835\udc50 \u2208[2, 5] such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc50) = 1 5 \u22122 \u222b\ufe01 5 2 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 3 \u00b712 = 4, as required. While being able to compute average values is great, doing this requires us to calculate an integral \u2013 a process which has been painful and quite limited for us so far. As we will see in the coming sections, a better method for calculating integrals lies just ahead! Section 1.3 Problems 1.3.1. Find the average value of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 + 1, on [1, 5]. 1.3.2. The velocty of a car at time \ud835\udc61 seconds is given by \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) = 3\ud835\udc612 m/s. Section 1.3 Average Value of a Function 45 (a) Determine the average velocity of the car from \ud835\udc61 = 0 seconds to \ud835\udc61 = 4 seconds. (b) Determine the distance traveled by the car from from \ud835\udc61 = 0 seconds to \ud835\udc61 = 4 seconds. (c) Find \ud835\udc50 \u2208[0, 4] such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc50) equals the average velocity of \ud835\udc53 on [0, 4]. 1.3.3. Find all values of \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f\u2208R where \ud835\udc4f >0 so that the average value of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 3\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 on [0, \ud835\udc4f] is zero. 1.3.4. Let \ud835\udc53 be a continuous function. If \ud835\udc53avg[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] denotes the average value of \ud835\udc53 on the interval [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] and \ud835\udc4e < \ud835\udc50 < \ud835\udc4f, prove that \ud835\udc53avg[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] = \ud835\udc50 \u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53avg[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc50] + \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53avg[\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udc4f]. 1.3.5.

Its importance cannot be overstated. In order to introduce the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we must first explore the idea of an integral function. 1.4.1 Integral Functions and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus When you first learned about derivatives, you likely used the definition of the derivative to compute the slope of the tangent line to a given function \ud835\udc53 at some specific point \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. For instance, had you been asked to determine the derivative of a function \ud835\udc53 at \ud835\udc65 = 2 by definition, you would have calculated lim \u210e\u21920 \ud835\udc53(2 + \u210e) \u2212\ud835\udc53(2) \u210e . If you were then asked to compute the derivative of the same function \ud835\udc53 at \ud835\udc65 = 3, you would have to perform the whole calculation over again with 2 replaced by 3. Yuck! Of course, there is a more efficient way. Rather than using the definition of the derivative over and over, we can instead compute the derivative function, \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = lim \u210e\u21920 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65 + \u210e) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u210e , where \ud835\udc65 here is a variable. We can then simply substitute \ud835\udc65 = 2 or \ud835\udc65 = 3 or any other value of \ud835\udc65 to quickly calculate the slopes of the tangent lines at these points. There turns out to be a very similar notion for integrals! Let \ud835\udc53 be continuous. If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \u22650, we know that \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 represents the area under the graph of \ud835\udc53 for \ud835\udc61 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. Suppose we wish to calculate this area and have worked through the laborious task of doing so using the definition of the definite integral from Section 1.1. If we then wished to know the area on a different domain, say [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc50] for some \ud835\udc50 \u2208R, you would need to compute \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 using the definition of the integral all over again! Motivated by the above, instead of applying the definition of the definite integral repeatedly, you could use the definition just once with a variable as the upper limit of integration. That is, you could compute \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61, which is a function of \ud835\udc65 that outputs the area under the graph of \ud835\udc53 from \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc4e to \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc65.

Definition 1.4.1 Integral Function Let \ud835\udc4e \u2208R and let \ud835\udc53 be integrable on an interval \ud835\udc3c containing \ud835\udc4e. The function \ud835\udc3a : \ud835\udc3c \u2192R defined by \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 is called an integral function. Let\u2019s see a concrete example! Example 1.4.2 Let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) = 2\ud835\udc61 for \ud835\udc61 \u22650 and consider the integral function \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 0 2\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. The graph of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) = 2 \ud835\udc61 is a straight line, hence the function \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) \u2013 which represents the area under this straight line from \ud835\udc61 = 0 to \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc65 \u2013 is simply the area of the right triangle shaded in the figure below. \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) = 2\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 0 2\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc66 48 Chapter 1 Integration Thus, it follows that \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = 1 2 (base) (height) = 1 2(\ud835\udc65)(2\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652. We can now quickly calculate various definite integrals of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61). For instance, \u222b\ufe01 2 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3a(2) = 22 = 4, \u222b\ufe01 4/3 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3a (\ufe024 3 )\ufe02 = (\ufe024 3 )\ufe022 = 16 9 , and so on. There is an interesting connection that you may have noticed in the previous example: if we differentiate \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc65 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc652, we exactly obtain \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 2\ud835\udc65. That is, differentiation seems to \u201cundo\u201d the integral function, leaving us with the function \ud835\udc53 we started with. The connection we have witnessed in the above example is no coincidence. It is the first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus! Theorem 1.4.3 (The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) - Part I) Let \ud835\udc4e \u2208R. If \ud835\udc53 is continuous on an open interval \ud835\udc3c containing \ud835\udc4e, then the function \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 is differentiable for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c and \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65).

Observe that 1 \u210e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65+\u210e \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 Section 1.4 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - Part I 49 is the average value of \ud835\udc53 on the interval [\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc65+ \u210e]. Thus, for each \u210e \u0338= 0, the Average Value Theorem applied on the interval [ \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc65+ \u210e] states that there exists \ud835\udc50\u210e \u2208[\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc65+ \u210e] such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc50\u210e) = 1 \u210e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65+\u210e \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. Since \ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc50\u210e \u2264\ud835\udc65 + \u210e, it follows from the squeeze theorem that lim \u210e\u21920 \ud835\udc50\u210e = \ud835\udc65. Consequently, \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = lim \u210e\u21920 1 \u210e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65+\u210e \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = lim \u210e\u21920 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc50\u210e) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65), as desired. Before we explore more examples of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, take a moment to appreciate how surprising this result truly is. We introduced the definite integral by studying the area under a curve, a problem which \u2013 on the surface \u2013 is completely unrelated to that of calculating the slope of a tangent line. What we have just discovered, however, is that these two notions are intimately linked. Integration and differentiation are, in a strong sense, inverse operations of one another. We will explore this idea further in the next section. Example 1.4.4 What is \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 1 1 1 + \ud835\udc614 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61? Solution: Since \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) = 1 1+\ud835\udc614 is continuous, by Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 1 1 1 + \ud835\udc614 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = 1 1 + \ud835\udc654 . REMARKS (i) In Example 1.4.2, we were able to compute \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc65 0 2\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61by first evaluating the integral and then differentiating the resulting expression. Had we instead used Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we could have simply stated that since \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) = 2\ud835\udc61 is continuous, \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 0 2\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 2\ud835\udc65 and avoided integration altogether. This is the major advantage of using Part I of the FTC. This was particularly useful in Example 1.4.4, where the integration would have been more challenging. (ii) The specific value of the constant \ud835\udc4e is not important when calculating \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. This is because the derivative measures the change in \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 that results from a small change in the upper limit of integration, \ud835\udc65. So, in Example 1.4.4 for instance, it would also be true that \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 2 1 1 + \ud835\udc614",

In this section we will develop extensions of the FTC that allow us to differentiate integral functions whose bounds are more complicated. As a motivating example, consider the integral function \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 8\ud835\udc65+1 0 \u221a\ufe00 1 + \ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. Here, the lower limit of integration is a constant, though the upper limit is not simply \ud835\udc65 \u2013 it is a function of \ud835\udc65. To calculate \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc65) in this case, we will require the following extension of the FTC, which is really an application of the chain rule. Theorem 1.4.5 Let \ud835\udc4e \u2208R. If \ud835\udc53 is continuous and \u210e is differentiable, then \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))\u210e\u2032(\ud835\udc65). Proof: Consider the integral function \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. By Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). We then have \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc3a(\u210e(\ud835\udc65)) = \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))\u210e\u2032(\ud835\udc65) (by the chain rule) = \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))\u210e\u2032(\ud835\udc65). Let us now revisit our motivating example. Example 1.4.6 Evaluate \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 8\ud835\udc65+1 0 \u221a\ufe00 1 + \ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. Solution: Since \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) = \u221a 1 + \ud835\udc612 is continuous, by Theorem 1.4.5 with \u210e(\ud835\udc65) = 8 \ud835\udc65 + 1, we have \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 8\ud835\udc65+1 0 \u221a\ufe00 1 + \ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u221a\ufe00 1 + (8\ud835\udc65 + 1)2 (8\ud835\udc65 + 1)\u2032= 8 \u221a\ufe00 1 + (8\ud835\udc65 + 1)2 Section 1.4 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - Part I 51 Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be further extended to integral functions in which the lower limit of integration is also a function of\ud835\udc65.

Theorem 1.4.7 (Extended Version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - Part I) If \ud835\udc53 is continuous and \ud835\udc54 and \u210e are differentiable, then \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))\u210e\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65).

Hence, by Theorem 1.4.5, we have \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 (\ufe03\u222b\ufe01 \u210e(\ud835\udc65) 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 )\ufe03 = \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \u210e(\ud835\udc65) 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) 0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))\u210e\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65). Example 1.4.8 Evaluate \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 sin \ud835\udc65 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. Solution: Observe that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc612 is continuous. Thus, by Theorem 1.4.7 with \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = 2\ud835\udc65 and \u210e(\ud835\udc65) = sin \ud835\udc65, we have \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 sin \ud835\udc65 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc52(sin \ud835\udc65)2 (sin \ud835\udc65)\u2032\u2212\ud835\udc52(2\ud835\udc65)2 (2\ud835\udc65)\u2032= \ud835\udc52sin2 \ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 \u22122\ud835\udc524\ud835\udc652 . REMARK It was mentioned in Section 1.3 that the Average Value Theorem is sometimes referred to as the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals. At first glance, however, it may not be at all obvious how the Average Value Theorem and Mean Value Theorem are related. Fortunately, we are now equipped to make the relationship clear. Let \ud835\udc53 be continuous on an interval [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] and consider the integral function \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. 52 Chapter 1 Integration By Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,\ud835\udc3a is differentiable on (\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f) and \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). Thus, by the Mean Value Theorem applied to \ud835\udc3a on (\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f), there exists some \ud835\udc50 \u2208(\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f) such that \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc50) = \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc4f) \u2212\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e . (*) That is, since \ud835\udc3a\u2032= \ud835\udc53, there exists some \ud835\udc50 \u2208(\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f) such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc50) = \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc4f) \u2212\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e = \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e = 1 \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61.

Section 1.5 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - Part II 53 1.5 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - Part II Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows that differentiation and integra- tion are inverse operations of one another. In this section we will explore the notion of an antiderivative, which\u2014as the name suggests\u2014is also related to the idea of \u201cundoing\u201d differentiation. Our discussion will culminate in Part II of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, an invaluable tool for evaluating definite integrals. Definition 1.5.1 Antiderivative Given a function \ud835\udc53, an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53 is a function \ud835\udc39 such that \ud835\udc39\u2032= \ud835\udc53. Example 1.5.2 Consider \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc653. The function \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc654 4 is an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53, since \ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc653 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). Note, however, that this antiderivative is not unique. Indeed, \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc654 4 + 1 is also an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53 since \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc653 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) too. In fact, any function of the form \ud835\udc654 4 + \ud835\udc36, \ud835\udc36 \u2208R will be an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53, since the constant \ud835\udc36 disappears when differentiated! As observed in the example above, if \ud835\udc39 is an antiderivative of a function \ud835\udc53, then so too is \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36 for any \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. In fact, adding a constant to \ud835\udc39 turns out to be the only way to generate new antiderivatives for \ud835\udc53. You may remember this result from Section 4.4 of the MATH 137 course notes, though it is also included below for completeness. Its proof is an application of the Mean Value Theorem. Theorem 1.5.3 (The Antiderivative Theorem) If \ud835\udc39 and \ud835\udc3a are antiderivatives of a function \ud835\udc53 on an open interval \ud835\udc3c, then there exists a constant \ud835\udc36 \u2208R such that \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36. Proof: Let \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652 \u2208\ud835\udc3c with \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652. Since \ud835\udc39 and \ud835\udc3a are differentiable, so too is the function \ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65). Thus, by the Mean Value Theorem applied to \ud835\udc3b on the interval [\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652], there exists some \ud835\udc50 \u2208(\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) such that \ud835\udc3b\u2032(\ud835\udc50) = \ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc652) \u2212\ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc651) \ud835\udc652 \u2212\ud835\udc651 . But since \ud835\udc39 and \ud835\udc3a are both antiderivatives of \ud835\udc53, we have \ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc652) \u2212\ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc651) \ud835\udc652 \u2212\ud835\udc651 = \ud835\udc3b\u2032(\ud835\udc50) = \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc50) \u2212\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc50) =",

Since \ud835\udc651 and \ud835\udc652 were arbitrary, \ud835\udc3b must be constant on the interval \ud835\udc3c. That is, there exists some \ud835\udc36 \u2208R such that \ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc36 for all \ud835\udc65. Consequently, \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) +\ud835\udc36. Definition 1.5.4 Indefinite Integral The collection of all antiderivatives of a function \ud835\udc53 is called the indefinite integral of \ud835\udc53 and is denoted by the symbol \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. REMARK It may be somewhat unclear as to why we have chosen the term \u201cindefinite integral\u201d to represent the family of antiderivatives of a function \ud835\udc53. It turns out, however, that there are good reasons for this. Recall from Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that if \ud835\udc53 is continuous on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], then \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). That is, the function\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 is an antiderivative for\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). Hence, every continuous function has an antiderivative given by an integral function! The connections between integrals and antiderivatives will be soon be further explored in Part II of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Once we present this result, it will make more sense why we are using such similar terminology and notation for antiderivatives and integrals. Example 1.5.5 We saw in Example 1.5.2 that \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc654 4 is an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc653. Hence, it follows from Theorem 1.5.3 that all antiderivatives of \ud835\udc653 have the form \ud835\udc654 4 + \ud835\udc36 for some \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. Using the notation of Definition 1.5.4, \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc653 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc654 4 + \ud835\udc36. Example 1.5.6 Let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc657. It can be verified through differentiation that \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc658 8 is an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53. Thus, \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc657 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc658 8 + \ud835\udc36. Examples 1.5.5 and 1.5.6 can be generalized to a convenient formula for the antiderivatives of \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b, where \ud835\udc5b is (almost) any real number. This result is sometimes referred to as the power rule for antiderivatives .

(Ask yourself: Do I know a function with derivative 1 \ud835\udc65?) We can readily state the antiderivatives of various other functions by working backward from some of our known derivative formulas. For instance, since we know that cos \ud835\udc65 is the derivative of sin \ud835\udc65, it follows that sin \ud835\udc65 is an antiderivative of cos \ud835\udc65; hence \u222b\ufe01 cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= sin \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36. Likewise, since we know that 1 1+\ud835\udc652 is the derivative of arctan \ud835\udc65, it follows that arctan \ud835\udc65 is an antiderivative of 1 1+\ud835\udc652 ; hence \u222b\ufe01 1 1 + \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = arctan \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36.

The reason is that function 1 \ud835\udc65 is defined for all \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 0, while ln \ud835\udc65 is only defined for \ud835\udc65 >0.

(ii) When integrating a piecewise continuous function \ud835\udc53, the constant \ud835\udc36 arising from the integral is, in reality,piecewise constant, representing different constants on each piece of the domain of \ud835\udc53. For instance, the function \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc65 is piecewise continuous on ( \u2212\u221e, 0) \u222a(0, \u221e). Its antiderivatives have the form ln |\ud835\udc65|+ \ud835\udc36, but \ud835\udc36 may actually be defined differently on (0, \u221e) than on ( \u2212\u221e, 0). As an example, the function \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = {\ufe02 ln |\ud835\udc65|+ 2 if \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u2212\u221e, 0) ln |\ud835\udc65|\u22121 if \ud835\udc65 \u2208(0, \u221e) is an antiderivative for \ud835\udc53, since differentiating each piece produces 1 \ud835\udc65. For simplicity, we still denote this piecewise constant by \u201c \ud835\udc36\u201d. It turns out that knowing an antiderivative for a function \ud835\udc53 has a major benefit: the an- tiderivative can be used to quickly and efficiently evaluate \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 without applying the limit definition of the definite integral! This is Part II of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus! Theorem 1.5.8 (The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) - Part II) If \ud835\udc53 is continuous on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] and \ud835\udc39 is any antiderivative of \ud835\udc53, then \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc4f) \u2212\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc4e). Section 1.5 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - Part II 57 Proof: Consider the integral function \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. Since \ud835\udc53 is continuous, by Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, \ud835\udc3a\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). That is, \ud835\udc3a is an antiderivative for \ud835\udc53. Since \ud835\udc39 is also an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53, by Theorem 1.5.3, there exists a constant \ud835\udc36 such that \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36.

REMARK If \ud835\udc39 is an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53 as in Theorem 1.5.8, we use the notation [ \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65)]\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e or \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e to denote the expression \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc4f) \u2212\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc4e).

Since antiderivatives vary only up to addition of a constant, \ud835\udc36, we often use \ud835\udc36 = 0 for simplicity. To illustrate just how much more efficient integral computations have just become, consider the example below. Recall that we evaluated this integral with much effort in Example 1.1.10 using the definition of the definite integral.

Solution: Since \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \u2212cos \ud835\udc65 is an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = sin \ud835\udc65, we have \u222b\ufe01 2\ud835\udf0b 0 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= [\u2212cos \ud835\udc65]2\ud835\udf0b 0 = \u2212cos(2\ud835\udf0b) \u2212(\u2212cos(0)) = \u22121 \u2212(\u22121) = 0. Observe that this answer is consistent with our interpretation of the definite integral as a signed area between the graph of sin \ud835\udc65 and the \ud835\udc65-axis. \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = sin(\ud835\udc65) 2\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 By symmetry of the graph on the interval [0, 2\ud835\udf0b], there is the same amount of area between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and above the \ud835\udc65-axis as there is between the graph of \ud835\udc53 and below the \ud835\udc65-axis. Thus, an answer of 0 makes sense here. Example 1.5.11 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 1 \u22121 |2\ud835\udc65 \u22121|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: It may be a bit challenging to think of an antiderivative of |2\ud835\udc65 \u22121|. Instead, note that |2\ud835\udc65 \u22121| = {\ufe03 2\ud835\udc65 \u22121 if 2 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 \u22650 \u2212(2\ud835\udc65 \u22121) if 2 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 < 0 = {\ufe03 2\ud835\udc65 \u22121 if \ud835\udc65 \u22651 2 1 \u22122\ud835\udc65 if \ud835\udc65 <1 2 . By separating the domain of integration, [ \u22121, 1], into a union of two intervals \u2013 one from \ud835\udc65 = \u22121 to \ud835\udc65 = 1 2 and the other from \ud835\udc65 = 1 2 to \ud835\udc65 = 1 \u2013 we obtain: \u222b\ufe01 1 \u22121 |2\ud835\udc65 \u22121|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 1/2 \u22121 |2\ud835\udc65 \u22121|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 1 1/2",

Hopefully you are now starting to see that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus really does live up to its name. Thanks this amazing piece of mathematics, our ability to evaluate integrals is limited only by our ability to find antiderivatives. It should be noted, however, that finding antiderivatives can itself be very challenging! The next several sections will therefore be devoted to exploring techniques for obtaining antiderivatives for various functions. 60 Chapter 1 Integration Before getting into the more involved methods, let us conclude this section by exploring some tricks for obtaining antiderivatives of a few (slightly) more complicated functions. Recognizing when and how to apply these tricks yourself requires lots of practice, so make sure to try the end-of-section exercises! Example 1.5.12 Evaluate the following indefinite integrals. (a) \u222b\ufe01 (\ud835\udc65 + 1)2 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 Solution: To simplify the problem, we expand the expression in the numerator and separate the resulting terms over the denominator. We have \u222b\ufe01 (\ud835\udc65 + 1)2 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe02\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc65 + 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc65 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc65 + 2 + 1 \ud835\udc65 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc652 2 + 2\ud835\udc65 + ln|\ud835\udc65|+ \ud835\udc36.

(d) \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc652 + 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 Solution: The integrand looks somewhat similar to 1 \ud835\udc652+1 , which we know has arctan\ud835\udc65 as an antiderivative. Of course, the difference is that our integrand has a numerator of \ud835\udc652, not 1. A trick that will offer a path forward is to add and subtract 1 in the numerator and separate the resulting fraction: \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc652 + 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 (\ud835\udc652 + 1) \u22121 \ud835\udc652 + 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe02\ud835\udc652 + 1 \ud835\udc652 + 1 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc652 + 1 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe02 1 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc652 + 1 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65 \u2212arctan \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36. Note: the decomposition \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc652+1 = 1 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc652+1 could alternatively be obtained through polynomial long division. REMARK As we have seen, Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus implies that every contin- uous function has an antiderivative given by an integral function. It is not true, however, that every continuous function has an antiderivative that can be expressed usingelementary functions, including polynomials, roots, logarithms, exponential functions, trigonometric functions, and other functions we are accustomed to working with. Some examples of continuous functions that do not have elementary antiderivatives include \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 , sin(\ud835\udc652), cos(\ud835\udc652), 3 \u221a\ufe00 1 \u2212\ud835\udc653, and there are many, many more. So, for instance, while \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 0 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 is an antiderivative for \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 , there is no way to express \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) in elementary terms. Proving that a given function has no elementary antiderivative requires high-level algebra that is well beyond the scope of our study. If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) fails to have an elementary antiderivative, Part II of the FTC will not be helpful in evaluating \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e",

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is a very powerful result, but it relies on us be- ing able to find an elementary antiderivative (that is, an antiderivative made up of elementary functions such as polynomials, roots, trig and inverse trig functions, exponentials and logs). This is not always possible. For example, the function \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 has an antiderivative since it is continuous, but there is no way to express its antiderivative, \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc65 0 \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, in terms of elementary functions. Still, its antiderivative has great importance in probability, statistics, and engineering. In particular, it is used to describe what is known as the error function: erf(\ud835\udc65) = 2\u221a\ud835\udf0b \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 0 \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61.

Section 1.6 The Substitution Rule 63 1.6 The Substitution Rule The first integration technique we will examine is the reverse of the chain rule for derivatives. It is known as the substitution rule or change of variables . 1.6.1 The Substitution Rule for Indefinite Integrals To motivate the technique, consider the calculation of the derivative of ( \ud835\udc652 + 1)7 via the chain rule: [\ufe00 (\ud835\udc652 + 1)7]\ufe00\u2032 = 7(\ud835\udc652 + 1)6 \u00b7(\ud835\udc652 + 1)\u2032 = 7(\ud835\udc652 + 1)6 \u00b72\ud835\udc65 = 14\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 1)6. Since (\ud835\udc652 + 1)7 is therefore an antiderivative of 14 \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 1)6, it follows that \u222b\ufe01 14\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 1)6 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = (\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 + 1 )\ufe007 + \ud835\udc36. We have just evaluated the indefinite integral of 14\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 +1)6, a fairly complicated function. This is great, but it may feel a bit unsatisfying since we started the calculation with the antiderivative (\ud835\udc652+1)7. The substitution rule gives us a way to evaluate the integral without knowing the answer up front. Before formally stating the substitution rule, let\u2019s explore how it can be used in this example. To evaluate \u222b\ufe00 14\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 1)6 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, we will replace \ud835\udc652 + 1 with a new variable which we will call \ud835\udc62. The differential \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 can also be expressed in terms of \ud835\udc62 by differentiating \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc652 + 1 with respect to \ud835\udc65: \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc652 + 1 = \u21d2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 2\ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 2\ud835\udc65. Replacing \ud835\udc652 + 1 with \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 2\ud835\udc65 , we obtain a new integral that is easier to evaluate: \u222b\ufe01 14\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 1)6 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 14\ud835\udc65 \u00b7\ud835\udc626 \u00b7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 2\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 7\ud835\udc626 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc627 + \ud835\udc36. Finally, since \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc652 + 1, we can express our answer in terms of the original variable, \ud835\udc65. Sure enough, we arrive at the answer we expected from the derivative calculations above: \u222b\ufe01 14\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 1)6 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc627 + \ud835\udc36 = (\ud835\udc652 + 1)7 + \ud835\udc36. Now that we have seen the substitution rule in action, let us formally state the theorem and examine its proof. 64 Chapter 1 Integration Theorem 1.6.1 (Substitution Rule / Change of Variables) If \ud835\udc53 and \ud835\udc54 are functions such that \ud835\udc54\u2032is continuous on an interval [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] and \ud835\udc53 is continuous on the range of \ud835\udc54, then \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc62) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc62=\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) .

This is exactly what we did in the preceding example when we replaced \ud835\udc62 with \ud835\udc652 + 1 at the end of the calculation. Proof: Let \ud835\udc39 be an antiderivative for \ud835\udc53, so \ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). By the chain rule, we have (\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)))\u2032= \ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65), so \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) is an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65).

The general strategy when evaluating an integral with the substitution rule is to define a new variable \ud835\udc62 to represent some part of the integrand, say \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65). We then compute the differential \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 and substitute \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 into the integral. If done effectively, the integral will be easier to evaluate in this new form than it was originally. Finally, remember to replace \ud835\udc62 with \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) at the end of the calculation! Often, one of the most challenging aspects of performing an effective substitution is knowing how to define \ud835\udc62. Intuition for this comes from practice, but below are some general tips that will provide a bit of guidance. These tips are illustrated in the examples that follow. Effective Choices for \ud835\udc62: (i) Let \ud835\udc62 be the base of an expression raised to a complicated power. (ii) Let \ud835\udc62 be the inner function in a function composition. (iii) Let \ud835\udc62 be a function whose derivative is also present in the integrand. Section 1.6 The Substitution Rule 65 Example 1.6.2 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652\u221a\ufe00 \ud835\udc653 + 4\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: Since we see the expression\ud835\udc653+4 being raised to the power of1 2 , letting \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc653+4 may help to simplify the integral. Further support for this choice comes from the fact that the integrand contains \ud835\udc652, which is very close to the derivative of \ud835\udc653 + 4 and should cancel out nicely when we substitute \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62. Indeed, we have \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc653 + 4 = \u21d2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 3\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 3\ud835\udc652 . Substituting \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 into the integral, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652\u221a\ufe00 \ud835\udc653 + 4\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652\u221a\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 3\ud835\udc652 = 1 3 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc621/2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 1 3 \ud835\udc623/2 3/2 + \ud835\udc36 = 2 9\ud835\udc623/2 + \ud835\udc36. Lastly, we express our answer in terms of \ud835\udc65 using \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc653 + 4: \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652\u221a\ufe00 \ud835\udc653 + 4\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 2 9\ud835\udc623/2 + \ud835\udc36 = 2 9 (\ufe00 \ud835\udc653 + 4 )\ufe003/2 + \ud835\udc36.

First: sin \ud835\udc65 is being raised to a high power. Second: the derivative of \ud835\udc62 = sin \ud835\udc65 (i.e., cos \ud835\udc65) also appears in the integrand. By setting \ud835\udc62 = sin \ud835\udc65 and computing \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 sin8 \ud835\udc65\u23df \u23de \ud835\udc628 cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\u23df \u23de \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc628 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc629 9 + \ud835\udc36 = sin9 \ud835\udc65 9 + \ud835\udc36.

Unlike in our earlier examples, there is an \ud835\udc65 term that did not cancel out when we substituted \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 into the integral. When this occurs, we must first express \ud835\udc65 in terms of \ud835\udc62 before proceeding with the integration. In this case, \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc65 + 2 = \u21d2 \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc62 \u22122. Hence, the integral becomes \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 3\u221a\ud835\udc65 + 2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc62 \u22122 3\u221a\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \u222b\ufe01 (\ud835\udc62 \u22122)\ud835\udc62\u22121/3 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe01 \ud835\udc622/3 \u22122\ud835\udc62\u22121/3 )\ufe01 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc625/3 5/3 \u22122 \ud835\udc622/3 2/3 + \ud835\udc36 = 3 5(\ud835\udc65 + 2)5/3 \u22123(\ud835\udc65 +",

Section 1.6 The Substitution Rule 67 Change of variables can be used to establish the following handy fact when integrating a function composed with a constant multiple of \ud835\udc65. We will use this fact frequently and often without reference. Theorem 1.6.4 (Integrating \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65)) Let \ud835\udc4e \u2208R, \ud835\udc4e \u0338= 0. If \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36, then \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36. Proof: With \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65, we have \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, or equivalently, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62. Consequently, \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udc4e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc62) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc62) + \ud835\udc36 = 1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36. Example 1.6.5 Since we know that \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36, it follows from Theorem 1.6.4 that, \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc523\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 3\ud835\udc523\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36. Similarly, for any \ud835\udc4e \u0338= 0, we have \u222b\ufe01 sin(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u22121 \ud835\udc4e cos(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36 and \u222b\ufe01 cos(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udc4e sin(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36. Change of variables can also be used to find an antiderivative for sec \ud835\udc65, which was a long- standing unsolved problem in mathematics from 1569-1668. The details \u2013 along with a clever hint for starting the calculations \u2013 are presented in the following example. Example 1.6.6 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 sec \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Hint: Write the integral as \u222b\ufe01 sec \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \u222b\ufe01 sec \ud835\udc65 (\ufe02sec \ud835\udc65 + tan\ud835\udc65 sec \ud835\udc65 + tan\ud835\udc65 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: Following the hint, we multiply and divide the integrand by sec \ud835\udc65 + tan \ud835\udc65 to obtain \u222b\ufe01 sec \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \u222b\ufe01 sec \ud835\udc65 (\ufe02sec \ud835\udc65 + tan\ud835\udc65 sec \ud835\udc65 + tan\ud835\udc65 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 sec2 \ud835\udc65 + sec\ud835\udc65 tan \ud835\udc65 sec \ud835\udc65 + tan\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. 68 Chapter 1 Integration In the final integral above, notice that the numerator of the integrand is exactly the derivative of the denominator. Thus, if we let \ud835\udc62 = sec \ud835\udc65 + tan \ud835\udc65 and compute \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 =(\ufe00 sec \ud835\udc65 tan \ud835\udc65 + sec2 \ud835\udc65 )\ufe00 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 sec \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \u222b\ufe01 sec2 \ud835\udc65 + sec\ud835\udc65 tan \ud835\udc65 sec \ud835\udc65 + tan\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = ln |\ud835\udc62|+ \ud835\udc36 = ln |sec \ud835\udc65 + tan\ud835\udc65|+ \ud835\udc36. The idea of multiplying and dividing sec \ud835\udc65 by sec\ud835\udc65+tan \ud835\udc65 to set the stage for a substitution does not easily generalize to integrals of other functions. That is, it is more of a \u201ctrick\u201d that works",

The antiderivatives of sec \ud835\udc65 and csc \ud835\udc65 are recorded below for later reference.

The only difference is that we must now also adjust the limits of integration when rewriting the integral in terms of \ud835\udc62. Theorem 1.6.8 (Substitution Rule/Change of Variables for Definite Integrals) If \ud835\udc53 and \ud835\udc54 are functions such that \ud835\udc54\u2032is continuous on an interval [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] and \ud835\udc53 is continuous on the range of \ud835\udc54, then \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc62=\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4f) \ud835\udc62=\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc62) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62. Section 1.6 The Substitution Rule 69 Proof: Let \ud835\udc39 be an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53. By Part II of the Fundamental Theorem of Cal- culus, \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4f) \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc62) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = [\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc62)]\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4f) \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4f)) \u2212\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4e)). Similarly, since we know that \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) is an antiderivative of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65), \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = [\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65))]\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4f)) \u2212\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4e)). Since both integrals evaluate to the same expression, they are equal to each other: \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4f) \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc62) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62. Theorem 1.6.8 states that when using a substitution \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) to evaluate an integral with limits of integration \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f, the new limits of integration can be obtained by substituting \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f into the equation \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65). Example 1.6.9 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: Note that \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 appears as the inner function in a composition and its derivative (also \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) appears as a factor in the integrand. We therefore let \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, so \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. For the limits of integration, observe that when \ud835\udc65 = 0, we have \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc520 = 1; and when \ud835\udc65 = 1, we have \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc521 = \ud835\udc52. Thus, the integral becomes \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =",

To see this alternative approach in practice, consider once again the integral \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 from Example 1.6.9. Again, letting \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 and computing \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, we have 70 Chapter 1 Integration \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65=1 \ud835\udc65=0 cos(\ud835\udc62) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = [sin(\ud835\udc62)]\ud835\udc65=1 \ud835\udc65=0 = [sin(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65)]\ud835\udc65=1 \ud835\udc65=0 = sin(\ud835\udc521) \u2212sin(\ud835\udc520) = sin(\ud835\udc52) \u2212sin(1). REMARK While either approach to dealing with the limits of integration is mathematically correct, the method of expressing the limits as \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4e) and \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4f) is often preferred since there is then no need to further consider the original variable, \ud835\udc65. That is, the integral in terms of \ud835\udc65 has been fully converted to an integral in terms of \ud835\udc62. If you do choose to leave the limits of integration in terms of \ud835\udc65, it is important to clearly indicate this in your calculations. We were explicit about leaving the limits in terms of \ud835\udc65 in the calculation above by writing the limits as \u201c \ud835\udc65 = 0\u201d and \u201c \ud835\udc65 = 1\u201d, rather than just \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d. Without the \u201c \ud835\udc65 =\u201d in an integral otherwise written in terms of \ud835\udc62, readers will assume that the limits of integration are \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4e) and \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc4f). Writing \u201c\ud835\udc65 =\u201d avoids potential confusion here. As an alternative approach that involves less fuss over the limits, one could first calculate the indefinite integral of \ud835\udc53 (i.e., remove the limits of integration altogether) and then, in a subsequent calculation, reintroduce the limits and evaluate the integral using the Fun- damental Theorem of Calculus. When computing \u222b\ufe001 0 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, for example, we could temporarily drop the limits and calculate \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 cos(\ud835\udc62) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = sin(\ud835\udc62) + \ud835\udc36 = sin(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36. We then evaluate the desired definite integral as \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = [sin(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65)]1 0 = sin(\ud835\udc521) \u2212sin(\ud835\udc520) = sin(\ud835\udc52).

Solution: Initially, it might not be immediately apparent how we will approach evaluating this integral. However, if we rewrite the integral as \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b/3 0 tan \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b/3 0 sin \ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, we may see a way forward. In particular, since sin \ud835\udc65 is nearly the derivative of cos \ud835\udc65, we will try the substitution \ud835\udc62 = cos \ud835\udc65. We compute \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \u2212sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65and update the limits of Section 1.6 The Substitution Rule 71 integration as follows: \ud835\udc65 = 0 = \u21d2 \ud835\udc62 = cos \ud835\udc65 = cos 0 = 1 \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b 3 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc62 = cos \ud835\udc65 = cos \ud835\udf0b 3 = 1 2 We then obtain \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b/3 0 tan \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b/3 0 sin \ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 1/2 1 1 \ud835\udc62 (\u2212\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62) (since \u2212\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65) = \u2212[ln |\ud835\udc62|]1/2 1 = \u2212 \u239b \u239dln \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 1 2 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u2212ln |1|\u23df \u23de =0 \u239e \u23a0 = \u2212ln (\ufe021 2 )\ufe02 (or ln 2, using logarithm laws.) As seen in the above example, the antiderivatives of tan \ud835\udc65 = sin \ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 can be found using the substitution \ud835\udc62 = cos \ud835\udc65. Similarly, one can find the antiderivatives of cot \ud835\udc65 = cos \ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 using the substitution \ud835\udc62 = sin \ud835\udc65. We record these antiderivatives below for later reference.

This will happen if the function \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) is decreasing. It is nothing to worry about, however \u2013 simply proceed with the calculation as we did above.

However, even if we didn\u2019t happen to recognize 1\u221a 1\u2212\ud835\udc652 as the derivative of a familiar function, there is a useful technique that would nevertheless allow us to evaluate \u222b\ufe00 1\u221a 1\u2212\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. This technique \u2013 which is a variation on the substitution method from the previous section \u2013 involves replacing \ud835\udc65 with a trigonometric function and using trigonometric identities to simplify the integral. In our example, it will be useful to let \ud835\udc65 = sin \ud835\udf03, hence \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = cos \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03. By restricting \ud835\udf03 to the interval \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 \u2264\ud835\udf03 \u2264\ud835\udf0b 2 and recognizing that sin \ud835\udf03 is invertible on this domain, making the substitution \ud835\udc65 = sin \ud835\udf03 is equivalent to writing \ud835\udf03 = arcsin \ud835\udc65. Using this substitution and the identity sin2 \ud835\udf03+cos2 \ud835\udf03 = 1, the expression \u221a 1 \u2212\ud835\udc652 simplifies to \u221a\ufe00 1 \u2212\ud835\udc652 = \u221a\ufe00 1 \u2212sin2 \ud835\udf03 = \u221a cos2 \ud835\udf03 = |cos \ud835\udf03|= cos \ud835\udf03, where the final equality follows from the fact that cos \ud835\udf03 \u22650 when \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 \u2264\ud835\udf03 \u2264\ud835\udf0b 2 . Thus, the integral evaluates to \u222b\ufe01 1\u221a 1 \u2212\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 1 cos \ud835\udf03 \u00b7cos \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03= \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udf03 + \ud835\udc36 = arcsin \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36, just as we expected! The technique we have just explored is called trigonometric substitution. Before discussing the general technique, let us make a remark about its use in the example above. REMARK In the previous section, all of the substitutions were of the form \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65), with the new variable, \ud835\udc62, being expressed as a function of the original variable, \ud835\udc65. In the example above, the substitution \ud835\udc65 = sin \ud835\udf03 was done in reverse, with the original variable being expressed as a function of the new variable. This new method has the advantage that we do not need to rearrange anything to express \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 in terms of \ud835\udf03; \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 is already isolated on the left-hand side when we differentiate \ud835\udc65 = sin \ud835\udf03! In general, a trigonometric substitution can help when evaluating integrals involving ex- pressions of the form \u221a \ud835\udc4e2 \u2212\ud835\udc652, \u221a \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4e2, or \u221a \ud835\udc652 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2, where \ud835\udc4e is a constant.

This is important, as we will need to be able to convert our antiderivatives in terms of \ud835\udf03 back into functions of the original variable, \ud835\udc65. It will be especially important to be mindful of the domains when using trigonometric substitution with definite integrals, as we will need to be careful when converting the limits of integration. See Example 1.7.3. For information on why it is convenient to work over these specific domains, see the remark following Example 1.7.2. Example 1.7.1 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 1\u221a \ud835\udc652 + 9 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: Let \ud835\udc65 = 3 tan\ud835\udf03, where \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 < \ud835\udf03 <\ud835\udf0b 2 . We have \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 3 sec2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03, and hence \u222b\ufe01 1\u221a \ud835\udc652 + 9 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 1\u221a\ufe00 9 (tan2 \ud835\udf03 + 1) 3 sec2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03 = \u222b\ufe01 3 sec2 \ud835\udf03\u221a 9 sec2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03 (since tan2 \ud835\udf03 + 1 = sec2 \ud835\udf03) = \u222b\ufe01 3 sec2 \ud835\udf03 3|sec \ud835\udf03|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03. Since sec \ud835\udf03 >0 when \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 < \ud835\udf03 <\ud835\udf0b 2 , the absolute value can be removed: \u222b\ufe01 1\u221a \ud835\udc652 + 9 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 3 sec2 \ud835\udf03 3 sec\ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03 = \u222b\ufe01 sec \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03= ln |sec \ud835\udf03 + tan\ud835\udf03|+ \ud835\udc36, where the antiderivative of sec \ud835\udc65 is known to us from Theorem 1.6.7. Finally, we must express our answer in terms \ud835\udc65. If we interpret \ud835\udf03 as an angle in a right triangle, the equation tan \ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udc65 3 from our initial substitution represents the ratio opposite adjacent. Below we have constructed a right triangle with opposite side \ud835\udc65 and adjacent side 3 and have calculated the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean Theorem: \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 9 \ud835\udc65 3 \ud835\udf03 76 Chapter 1 Integration From this diagram, we see that sec \ud835\udf03 = hypotenuse adjacent = \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 9 3 and tan \ud835\udf03 = opposite adjacent = \ud835\udc65 3 ; hence \u222b\ufe01 1\u221a \ud835\udc652 + 9 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = ln |sec \ud835\udf03 + tan\ud835\udf03|+ \ud835\udc36 = ln \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 9 3 + \ud835\udc65 3 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 + \ud835\udc36.

For instance, in Example 1.7.1, the substitution \ud835\udc65 = 3 tan\ud835\udf03 for \ud835\udf03 \u2208 (\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 , \ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe00 led to an expression of the form \u221a\ufe01 9(tan2 \ud835\udf03 + 1) = \u221a 9 sec2 \ud835\udf03 = 3|sec \ud835\udf03|, which we were able to simplify to 3 sec \ud835\udf03 since sec \ud835\udf03 >0 on the interval (\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 , \ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe00 . If the integrand includes \ud835\udc4e2 \u2212\ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4e2, or \ud835\udc652 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2 but not necessarily the square root of such an expression, a trigonometric substitution may still be helpful. This can be is seen in the following example. Before we begin, it may help to take note of the following identities: sin2 \ud835\udf03 = 1 2 (1 \u2212cos 2\ud835\udf03) , cos2 \ud835\udf03 = 1 2 (1 + cos 2\ud835\udf03) . These identities can be very useful when integrating sin 2 \ud835\udf03 or cos2 \ud835\udf03. While you may not recognize them at first, they are obtained simply by rearranging the familiar cosine double angle identities cos 2\ud835\udf03 = 1 \u22122 sin2 \ud835\udf03 and cos 2\ud835\udf03 = 2 cos2 \ud835\udf03 \u22121, respectively. 78 Chapter 1 Integration Example 1.7.3 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc652 (\ud835\udc652 + 1)2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: Since the integral contains the expression \ud835\udc652 + 1 \u2013 which we can think of as(\ufe01\u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1 )\ufe012 \u2013 we will attempt the trigonometric substitution \ud835\udc65 = tan \ud835\udf03 with \ud835\udf03 \u2208 (\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 , \ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe00 . This time we are working with a definite integral and must therefore address the limits of integration. The upper limit of integration is \ud835\udc65 = tan \ud835\udf03 = 1. Note that while there are many values of \ud835\udf03 such that tan \ud835\udf03 = 1, only one of these values lies in the interval (\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 , \ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe00 : \ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udf0b 4 . This will be the new upper limit of integration. Similarly, the lower limit of integration is \ud835\udc65 = tan \ud835\udf03 = 0. The only value of \ud835\udf03 \u2208 (\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 , \ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe00 for which tan \ud835\udf03 = 0 is \ud835\udf03 = 0. This will be the new lower limit of integration. Computing \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = sec2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03, we have \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc652 (\ud835\udc652 + 1)2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b/4 0 tan2 \ud835\udf03 (tan2 \ud835\udf03 + 1)2 sec2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b/4 0 tan2 \ud835\udf03 sec2 \ud835\udf03 (sec2 \ud835\udf03)2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03 (since tan2 \ud835\udf03 + 1 = sec2 \ud835\udf03) = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b/4 0 tan2 \ud835\udf03 sec2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03 =",

In each of these cases, we have the square root Section 1.7 Trigonometric Substitution 79 of a quadratic with no linear term. If we happen to encounter the square root of a more general quadratic, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc50, a trigonometric substitution may still be helpful. The idea is to rewrite the quadratic in a form that more closely resembles \ud835\udc4e2 \u2212\ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4e2, or \ud835\udc652 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2. We do this by completing the square! Note that a detailed review of completing the square can be found in Section 0.2. Example 1.7.4 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 \u22123 \ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: The integrand includes the expression \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 \u22123. Completing the square, we have \u221a\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 \u22123 = \u221a\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 + 1)2 \u22124. We now have an expression of the form \u221a \ud835\udc622 \u22124 where \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc65 + 1. This is suggestive of the trigonometric substitution \ud835\udc62 = 2 sec \ud835\udf03 with \ud835\udf03 \u2208 [\ufe00 0, \ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe00 \u222a [\ufe00 \ud835\udf0b, 3\ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe00 . Rather than performing two separate substitutions, however, we can streamline this process by simply letting \ud835\udc65 + 1 = 2 sec\ud835\udf03 , \ud835\udf03 \u2208 [\ufe01 0, \ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe01 \u222a [\ufe02 \ud835\udf0b, 3\ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe02 .

(To be precise, we might say that the ellipse has a semi-axis of length \ud835\udc4e in the \ud835\udc65-direction and a semi-axis of length \ud835\udc4f in the \ud835\udc66-direction.) \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc4e2 + \ud835\udc662 \ud835\udc4f2 = 1 \u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f \u2212\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 Using integration, we can calculate the area enclosed by the ellipse.

For the bounds, note that when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e sin \ud835\udf03 = 0, we have sin \ud835\udf03 = 0 and hence \ud835\udf03 = 0; and when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e sin \ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udc4e, we have sin \ud835\udf03 = 1, and hence \ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udf0b 2 .

In this section we will explore the reverse of the product rule for derivatives, which is an integration technique known as integration by parts. Recall that if \ud835\udc53 and \ud835\udc54 are differentiable, then the product rule for derivatives states that [\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)]\u2032= \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65). Equivalently, by rearranging this equation, \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = [\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)]\u2032\u2212\ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65). Integrating both sides of the equation above with respect to \ud835\udc65, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 [\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)]\u2032\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. We have just derived the formula for integration by parts! Theorem 1.8.1 (Integration by Parts (IBP)) If \ud835\udc53 and \ud835\udc54 are differentiable functions of \ud835\udc65, then \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. REMARK It is common to see the integration by parts formula presenting with letters \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc63 rep- resenting \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65), respectively. If \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65), then \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65; hence the IBP formula becomes \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63= \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc63 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62.

The hope is that this new integral is easier to evaluate than the original.

The function we designate 84 Chapter 1 Integration to be \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) will ultimately be differentiated to \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) on the right-hand side of the formula; while the function \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) will be antidifferentiated to \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65). Example 1.8.2 Consider the integral \u222b\ufe01 2\ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. We may view 2 \ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 as \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65), where \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 2 \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = cos \ud835\udc65. Calculating \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 2, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = sin \ud835\udc65, and applying the integration by parts formula, we have \u222b\ufe01 2\ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u23df \u23de \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 2\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 2 sin\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u23df \u23de \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)\u2212 \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 2\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 + 2 cos\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36 In the example above, the integral resulting from integration by parts was simpler to evaluate than integral we started with. This is always the goal when defining the functions \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65). Had we instead let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = cos \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 2\ud835\udc65, we would have \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u2212sin \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652, leading to the equation \u222b\ufe01 2\ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u23df \u23de \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc652 cos \ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u23df \u23de \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)\u2212 \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 . While there is nothing incorrect about this equation, it does not bring us closer to a solution. Indeed, \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65is even more challenging to evaluate than the original integral! REMARK A common strategy for choosing \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) is known as the LIATE method. LIATE is an acronym for the following hierarchy of functions: Logarithmic functions Inverse trigonometric functions Algebraic functions (e.g., \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b, polynomials, rational functions) Trigonometric functions Exponential functions The strategy is to let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) be the first function in the list above (when read top to bottom) that appears as part of the integrand. The remainder of the integrand is what we then call \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65).

The integrand is a product of an algebraic function and a logarithmic function. Both of these functions become simpler when differentiated, so it may not be obvious which should be \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and which should be \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65). Since ln \ud835\udc65 is more challenging to integrate, we will let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = ln \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652.

REMARK It does not matter if we write \ud835\udc36 or \u22122 3 \ud835\udc36 in our final answer to Example 1.8.6, as both of these expressions represent an arbitrary real number. Some instructors may prefer to write as \u22122 3 \ud835\udc36 or\u2014to distinguish \ud835\udc36 from \u22122\ud835\udc36 3 while still presenting their answer in a simple form\u2014may choose to use a new letter, say \ud835\udc37 = \u22122\ud835\udc36 3 , and state their answer as 1 3\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc523\ud835\udc65 \u22122 9\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc523\ud835\udc65 + 2 27\ud835\udc523\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc37. All of these approaches are acceptable. As the following two examples show, integration by parts may be a viable strategy even when the integrand is not an \u201cobvious\u201d product of functions. Example 1.8.7 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 ln \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: The integrand, ln \ud835\udc65, may not initially be recognizable at having the form \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65); however, we can apply integration by parts if we view ln \ud835\udc65 as the product ln \ud835\udc65 \u00b71! Indeed, letting \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = ln \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 1, we have \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc65. Hence, from the integration by parts formula, \u222b\ufe01 ln \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \ud835\udc65 ln \ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc65 \u00b7\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65 ln \ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 Section 1.8 Integration by Parts 87 = \ud835\udc65 ln \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36. Example 1.8.8 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 arctan \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: Similar to the previous example, we will think of the integrand as the product arctan \ud835\udc65 \u00b71. We may therefore use integration by parts with \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = arctan \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 1, hence \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 1 1+\ud835\udc652 and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc65. We obtain \u222b\ufe01 arctan \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \ud835\udc65 arctan \ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 1 + \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. In the resulting integral, the numerator, \ud835\udc65, is a multiple of derivative of the denominator, 1 + \ud835\udc652. Thus, substitution rule will likely be helpful. Letting \ud835\udc62 = 1 + \ud835\udc652, we compute \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

In some cases, applying integration by parts multiple times may actually produce (a multiple of) the integral we started with! For instance, we see this behavior when integrating func- tions of the form \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 sin(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65) or \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 cos(\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65) where \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f are constants. This is illustrated in the example below. Example 1.8.9 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Solution: It turns out that integration by parts works equally well here whether we choose to differentiate \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 or sin \ud835\udc65. Following the LIATE method, we will let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = sin \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65.

We compute \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = cos \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, hence from the integration by parts formula, \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. We are now faced with the task of evaluating the integral of a different product \u2013 this time, \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65. If we try integration by parts again with \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = cos \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, we compute \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u2212sin \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, obtaining \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \u2212 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 )\ufe02 88 Chapter 1 Integration = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 (sin \ud835\udc65 \u2212cos \ud835\udc65) \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. At first it may seem like we have gained little ground, as the integral we have produced on the right-hand side is the same as the integral we started with! However, we are actually very close to the final answer. By adding \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65to both sides of the equation above, we find that 2 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 (sin \ud835\udc65 \u2212cos \ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc36, (We have introduced a \u201c+C\u201d, since the right-hand side of the expression above represents an indefinite integral.) Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we obtain our final answer: \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65(sin \ud835\udc65 \u2212cos \ud835\udc65) 2 + \ud835\udc36. To close out this section, we will demonstrate how integration by parts can be used to establish a useful formula integrating powers of cos\ud835\udc65.

Similar to what we saw in Example 1.8.9, a multiple of the integral on the left-hand side of the equation above has appeared on the right-hand side. Adding ( \ud835\udc5b \u22121) \u222b\ufe00 cos\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65to both sides, we have \ud835\udc5b \u222b\ufe01 cos\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= cos\ud835\udc5b\u22121 \ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 + (\ud835\udc5b \u22121) \u222b\ufe01 cos\ud835\udc5b\u22122 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

That is, we will be studying integrals of the form \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, where \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc44 are polynomials. Recall that the degree of a polynomial \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65), denoted deg \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65), refers to the highest power of \ud835\udc65 that appears in the polynomial with a non-zero coefficient. For the time being, we will make one very important assumption about the degrees of \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) in the rational functions with which we will be working: that the degree of \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) is strictly smaller than the degree of \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65). Important assumption: deg \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) < deg \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65). We will learn how to handle cases in which deg \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \u2265deg \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) at the end of this section. In order to motivate the method of partial fractions, consider the problem of evaluating \u222b\ufe01 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)(\ud835\udc65 + 3) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. This integral may look challenging, but there\u2019s a trick: rewrite the integrand as 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)(\ud835\udc65 + 3) = 1 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 + 2 \ud835\udc65 + 3. (*) While it is likely not clear how we knew that the integrand could be broken up in this way, it should be easy enough to confirm that the expressions on the left- and right-hand sides are equal: simply recombine the terms on the right-hand side. We refer to the right-hand side of ( *) as a partial fraction",

This integral may look challenging, but there\u2019s a trick: rewrite the integrand as 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)(\ud835\udc65 + 3) = 1 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 + 2 \ud835\udc65 + 3. (*) While it is likely not clear how we knew that the integrand could be broken up in this way, it should be easy enough to confirm that the expressions on the left- and right-hand sides are equal: simply recombine the terms on the right-hand side. We refer to the right-hand side of ( *) as a partial fraction decomposition (or PFD) and refer to the individual terms 1 \ud835\udc65\u22121 and 2 \ud835\udc65\u22123 as partial fractions. Now that our function has been decomposed as a sum of simpler functions, integration is much easier.

Let\u2019s now investigate the process for finding partial fraction decomposition so that you can apply this technique yourself! Method Finding a PFD Let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) where \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc44 are polynomials and deg \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) < deg \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65). To find the partial fraction decomposition for \ud835\udc53, we carry out the following steps. 1. Fully factor \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors. 2. Based on the factors of \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65), write down theform of the partial fraction decomposition according to the table below.

Section 1.9 Partial Fractions 93 The table in step 2 of the above method sometimes causes a bit of confusion when first learning the method of partial fractions, but examples usually help to clarify what it is meant to convey. Let us therefore take some time to practice identifying just the form of the partial fraction decomposition before combining this with the other steps. Example 1.9.1 Determine the form of the partial fraction decomposition for each rational function below. (a) 1 (\ud835\udc65 + 2)(\ud835\udc65 + 4) Solution: Since the denominator is a product of distinct linear factors, the partial fraction decomposition will have the form 1 (\ud835\udc65 + 2)(\ud835\udc65 + 4) = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 + 2 + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc65 + 4 for some constants \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35. (b) \ud835\udc65 + 1 (\ud835\udc65 + 2)(\ud835\udc65 + 4) Solution: Just as in (a), the denominator is a product of distinct linear factors, hence the partial fraction decomposition will also have the form \ud835\udc65 + 1 (\ud835\udc65 + 2)(\ud835\udc65 + 4) = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 + 2 + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc65 + 4 (Importantly, note that while the form of the partial fraction decomposition is the same as in (a), the actual values of \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 will be different in these two examples.) (c) \ud835\udc652 + 1 \ud835\udc652(\ud835\udc65 + 7)3 Solution: The denominator is a product of linear factors, some of which are repeated. This includes \ud835\udc652, which is not an irreducible quadratic, but rather a product of re- peated linear factors: \ud835\udc65 \u00b7\ud835\udc65. The partial fraction decomposition will therefore have the form \ud835\udc652 + 1 \ud835\udc652(\ud835\udc65 + 7)3 = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc65 + 7 + \ud835\udc37 (\ud835\udc65 + 7)2 + \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc65 + 7)3 . (d) \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 3 (2\ud835\udc65 + 1)(\ud835\udc652 + 1) Solution: The denominator is a product of a linear factor, 2 \ud835\udc65 + 1, and an irreducible quadratic factor, \ud835\udc652 + 1.

Thus, the partial fraction decomposition has the form \ud835\udc653 + \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 1 (3\ud835\udc65 \u22121)2(\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 4)(\ud835\udc652 + 1)2 = \ud835\udc34 3\ud835\udc65 \u22121+ \ud835\udc35 (3\ud835\udc65 \u22121)2 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 4+\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc652 + 1 + \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc3b (\ud835\udc652 + 1)2 . Once we know the form of the partial fraction decomposition, Step 3 tells us that we must solve for the unknown constants: \ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc36, and so on. The easiest way to demonstrate this process is by example. Example 1.9.2 Determine the partial fraction decomposition for 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 \u22123. Solution: The denominator factors as \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 \u22123 = (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)(\ud835\udc65 + 3), which is a product of two distinct linear factors. Thus, the partial fraction decomposition will have the form 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 \u22123 = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc65 + 3 for some constants \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35. To solve for these constants, first multiply both sides of the above equation by \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 \u22123 = (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)(\ud835\udc65 + 3) to clear the denominators. We have 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 = (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)(\ud835\udc65 + 3) [\ufe02 \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc65 + 3 ]\ufe02 , or, equivalently, 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 = \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65 + 3) +\ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc65 \u22121) ( *) By expanding the right-hand side and collecting like terms, we obtain the equation 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 = (\ud835\udc34 + \ud835\udc35)\ud835\udc65 + (3\ud835\udc34 \u2212\ud835\udc35). Note that in order for 3 \ud835\udc65 + 1 and ( \ud835\udc34 + \ud835\udc35)\ud835\udc65 + (3\ud835\udc34 \u2212\ud835\udc35) to be equal functions, these polynomials must have the same coefficient for \ud835\udc65 and the same constant term. That is, the values connected in the equation below must be equal: 3 \ud835\udc65 + 1 = (\ud835\udc34 + \ud835\udc35) \ud835\udc65 + (3\ud835\udc34 \u2212\ud835\udc35) This leads to the system of equations {\ufe02 3 = \ud835\udc34 + \ud835\udc35 1 = 3 \ud835\udc34 \u2212\ud835\udc35 which we solve to obtain \ud835\udc34 = 1 and \ud835\udc35 = 2. The partial fraction decomposition is therefore 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 \u22123 = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc65 + 3 = 1 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 + 2 \ud835\udc65 + 3.

Section 1.9 Partial Fractions 95 Notice that the rational function in the example above is exactly the same function we used at the start of the section to motivate the method of partial fractions! REMARK There is an alternate approach one could use to determine the unknown coefficients \ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc36, and so on. To see how this approach works, consider once again the function 3\ud835\udc65+1 \ud835\udc652+2\ud835\udc65\u22123 in Example 1.9.2. After determining the form of the partial fraction decomposition and clearing the denomi- nators, we arrive at the equation below (labelled ( *) in the solution to Example 1.9.2): 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 = \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65 + 3) +\ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc65 \u22121) ( *) Since (*) must be true for all \ud835\udc65, we can substitute specific values of \ud835\udc65 into both sides and solve for \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35. If we choose our \ud835\udc65-values carefully, we can minimize the computations. Notice that \ud835\udc35 will be eliminated from ( *) when we substitute \ud835\udc65 = 1, leaving us with 3(1) + 1 = \ud835\udc34(1 + 3) +\ud835\udc35(1 \u22121) = \u21d2 4 = 4\ud835\udc34 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc34 = 1. Likewise, \ud835\udc34 will be eliminated from ( *) when we substitute \ud835\udc65 = \u22123, leaving us with 3(\u22123) + 1 = \ud835\udc34(\u22123 + 3) +\ud835\udc35(\u22123 \u22121) = \u21d2 \u22128 = \u22124\ud835\udc35 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc35 = 2. Sure enough, these values of \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 match those found in Example 1.9.2. Note that this method becomes more cumbersome when the denominator is not simply a product of distinct linear factors. If repeated linear factors or irreducible quadratic factors are present, the method of comparing coefficients is used in Example 1.9.2 is typically faster. Let\u2019s explore another example demonstrating the method of partial fractions. This time, we will not only find a partial fraction decomposition \u2013 we will use it to evaluate an integral! Example 1.9.3 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 8 \ud835\udc653 + 4\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 using a partial fraction decomposition. Solution: The denominator factors as \ud835\udc653 + 4\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 4), a product of a linear term and irreducible quadratic term. Thus, the partial fraction decomposition will have the form \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 8 \ud835\udc653 + 4\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 8 \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 4) = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc652 + 4 . (*) Multiplying through by \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 + 4) and collecting like-terms, we have \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 8 = \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc652 + 4) + (\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36)\ud835\udc65 96 Chapter",

By comparing the constant terms and the coefficients of \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc652 on both sides of this equation, we obtain the system of equations \u23a7 \u23a8 \u23a9 1 = \ud835\udc34 + \ud835\udc35 1 = \ud835\udc36 8 = 4 \ud835\udc34 , from which we find that \ud835\udc34 = 2, \ud835\udc35 = \u22121, and \ud835\udc36 = 1.

For \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc652+4 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, consider the substitution \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc652 + 4, hence \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. For \u222b\ufe00 1 \ud835\udc652+4 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, consider the trigonometric substitution \ud835\udc65 = 2 tan\ud835\udf03 for \ud835\udf03 \u2208 (\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udf0b 2 , \ud835\udf0b 2 )\ufe00 , hence \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 2 sec2 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf03.

Thus, to save time in future problems, it may be useful to note that for any \ud835\udc4e \u2208R with \ud835\udc4e \u0338= 0, \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4e2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udc4e arctan (\ufe01\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e )\ufe01 + \ud835\udc36. One can establish this fact using the trigonometric substitution \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e tan \ud835\udf03 as we did Example 1.9.3, or by rewriting the integral as \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4e2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udc4e2 \u222b\ufe01 1(\ufe00\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e )\ufe002 + 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 and using the \ud835\udc62-substitution \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e . Throughout this section, we have developed a method for finding the partial fraction decom- position of rational functions \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) with deg \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) < deg \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65). If it happens, however, that deg \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \u2265deg \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65), the rules we have learned for breaking up the function into partial fraction no longer apply. To see this, consider the rational function 3\ud835\udc653 + 16\ud835\udc652 + 8\ud835\udc65 \u22125 \ud835\udc652 + 5\ud835\udc65 . Here, the degree of the numerator is not smaller than the degree of the denominator. Despite the denominator factoring as \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc65 + 5), it is not true that there exist constants \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 such that 3\ud835\udc653 + 16\ud835\udc652 + 8\ud835\udc65 \u22125 \ud835\udc652 + 5\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc65 + 5. Indeed, if we recombine the terms on the right-hand side, we obtain (\ud835\udc34+\ud835\udc35)\ud835\udc65+5\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc652+5\ud835\udc65 , which is not equal to 3\ud835\udc653+16\ud835\udc652+8\ud835\udc65\u22125 \ud835\udc652+5\ud835\udc65 for any pair of real numbers \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 (since, for instance, there is no cubic term in the numerator on the right-hand side). The moral here is that we cannot simply follow our usual rules for obtaining the partial fraction decomposition if the degree of the numerator is not strictly less than the degree of the denominator. Fortunately, there is a way forward even in cases where this condition fails: If deg \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \u2265deg \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65), start by reducing \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) with polynomial long division. Continuing with the example of 3\ud835\udc653+16\ud835\udc652+8\ud835\udc65\u22125 \ud835\udc652+5\ud835\udc65 above, the polynomial long division for this function is as follows: 98 Chapter 1 Integration 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc652 + 5 \ud835\udc65 3\ud835\udc653 + 16 \ud835\udc652 + 8 \ud835\udc65 \u2212 5 3\ud835\udc653 + 15 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc652 + 8 \ud835\udc65 \u2212 5 \ud835\udc652 + 5 \ud835\udc65 3\ud835\udc65 \u2212 5 Recall that the polynomial above the division sign (in this case, 3 \ud835\udc65 + 1) is the quotient \u2013 it is the",

The polynomial at the very bottom (in this case, 3 \ud835\udc65 \u22125) is the remainder \u2013 it is the polynomial that could not be further divided by \ud835\udc652 + 5\ud835\udc65. We end the division once we obtain a reminder of degree less than that of the denominator. The result is an equation of the form Numerator Denominator = Quotient + Remainder Denominator. In our case, 3\ud835\udc653 + 16\ud835\udc652 + 8\ud835\udc65 \u22125 \ud835\udc652 + 5\ud835\udc65 = 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u22125 \ud835\udc652 + 5\ud835\udc65. Note that the resulting rational function, 3\ud835\udc65\u22125 \ud835\udc652+5\ud835\udc65, can now be decomposed into partial frac- tions using our usual methods since the degree of its numerator is strictly smaller than that of its denominator. We obtain 3\ud835\udc65 \u22125 \ud835\udc652 + 5\ud835\udc65 = 3\ud835\udc65 \u22125 \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc65 + 5) = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc65 + 5. As an exercise, one may verify that \ud835\udc34 = \u22121 and \ud835\udc35 = 4. We therefore obtain the partial fraction decomposition 3\ud835\udc653 + 16\ud835\udc652 + 8\ud835\udc65 \u22125 \ud835\udc652 + 5\ud835\udc65 = 3\ud835\udc65 + 1 \u22121 \ud835\udc65 + 4 \ud835\udc65 + 5. Let us end this section by exploring an integration example that makes use of the above technique. Example 1.9.4 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc653 \u22122\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 using a partial fraction decomposition. Solution: The degree of the numerator is not strictly less than the degree of the denomi- nator. We therefore begin with polynomial long division: \ud835\udc65 \u2212 2 \ud835\udc652 + 2 \ud835\udc65 + 1 \ud835\udc653 \u2212 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc653 + 2 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 \u2212 2\ud835\udc652 \u2212 3\ud835\udc65 \u2212 2\ud835\udc652 \u2212 4\ud835\udc65 \u2212 2 \ud835\udc65 + 2 Section 1.9 Partial Fractions 99 The result of the division is: \ud835\udc653 \u22122\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 + 1 = \ud835\udc65 \u22122 + \ud835\udc65 + 2 \ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc65 + 1.

Section 1.10 Improper Integrals 101 1.10 Improper Integrals Up to now, we have focused on integrating functions without vertical asymptotes over in- tervals of finite length (i.e., over intervals [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] where \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f are finite). In this section, we will build upon our existing knowledge to define integration over intervals of the form [\ud835\udc4e, \u221e), (\u2212\u221e, \ud835\udc4e], or ( \u2212\u221e, \u221e) and integration of functions with vertical asymptotes. Such integrals are known as improper integrals. 1.10.1 Improper Integrals of Type I We will begin by discussing integrals over intervals of the form [ \ud835\udc4e, \u221e) or ( \u2212\u221e, \ud835\udc4e], where \ud835\udc4e \u2208R. As a motivating example, consider the integral \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, which we will interpret as the area under the graph of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc654 and above the \ud835\udc65-axis for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[1, \u221e). At first, our intuition may suggest that this integral should simply evaluate to infinity \u2013 after all, the region whose area we are calculating extends infinitely far. Relying solely on intuition, however, can sometimes lead us astray. Instead, let\u2019s approach this problem mathematically! Rather than considering the integral over the entire domain all at once, let\u2019s consider some- thing we already know how to compute: the area under the curve from \ud835\udc65 = 1 to some finite upper limit, \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc61. This area is given by the integral \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61 1 1 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. The value of the integral is shown below for various choices of \ud835\udc61. \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc654 1 3 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61=3 1 1 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u22480.32099 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc654 81 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61=8 1 1 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u22480.33268 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc654 1 20 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61=20 1 1 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u22480.33329 While the value of the integral appears to be increasing with\ud835\udc61, it doesn\u2019t seem to be growing all that large. Even with a big upper limit, say \ud835\udc61 = 1000, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61=1000 1 1 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 0.333333333, 102 Chapter 1 Integration which is still slightly less than 1 3 . Perhaps it is possible that the area under the graph is finite! To know for sure, consider the limit of \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc61 1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 as the upper limit, \ud835\udc61, approaches infinity: lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61 1 1 \ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e [\ufe02\ud835\udc65\u22123 \u22123 ]\ufe02\ud835\udc61 1 = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \u22121 3 (\ufe02 1 \ud835\udc613 \u2212 1 13 )\ufe02 = 1 3 Remarkably, the limit is finite!

On the other hand, while 1 \ud835\udc65 also approaches 0, it does not do so quickly enough for the area between the graph and the \ud835\udc65-axis to remain bounded. Based on these examples, one might ask the natural question: For which \ud835\udc5d \u2208R does the integral \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 converge? We refer to \u222b\ufe00\u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 as a \ud835\udc5d-integral of type I. The convergence of these integrals is explored in the following theorem. Theorem 1.10.3 (Convergence of \ud835\udc5d-Integrals of Type I) If \ud835\udc5d >1, the improper integral \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 converges and \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udc5d \u22121. If \ud835\udc5d \u22641, the improper integral \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 diverges. Proof: It was shown in Example 1.10.2(i) that \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 diverges when \ud835\udc5d = 1. Assume now that \ud835\udc5d \u0338= 1. From the definition of the type I improper integral, we have \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61 1 \ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e [\ufe02 \ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 ]\ufe02\ud835\udc61 1 = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e (\ufe02 \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 \u2212 1\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 )\ufe02 Section 1.10 Improper Integrals 105 = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e (\ufe02 \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 \u2212 1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 )\ufe02 . Observe that if the exponent \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 is positive (i.e., \ud835\udc5d <1), then lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 = \u221e; hence \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e (\ufe02 \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 \u2212 1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 )\ufe02 = \u221e. That is, the integral diverges when \ud835\udc5d <1. If instead the exponent \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 is negative (i.e., \ud835\udc5d >1), then lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 = 0; hence \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e (\ufe02 \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 \u2212 1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 )\ufe02 = 0 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 \u2212 1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 = 1 \ud835\udc5d \u22121.

Solution: We could evaluate the integral exactly using the definition of a type I improper integral; but for fun, let\u2019s consider a different argument. Notice that the integral \u222b\ufe01 1 1/2 1 \ud835\udc654/3 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 is not improper and hence evaluates to some finite number. The integral \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc654/3 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 also evaluates to some finite number, as it is a \ud835\udc5d-integral of type I with \ud835\udc5d = 4 3 and hence is convergent by Theorem 1.10.3 (since \ud835\udc5d >1). Thus, \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1/2 1 \ud835\udc654/3 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 1 1/2 1 \ud835\udc654/3 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc654/3 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 must also converge, as it is equal to a sum of two finite integrals.

In this case, we are integrating a function \ud835\udc53 over the entire \ud835\udc65-axis. We will approach integrals of this form by dealing with the two infinities separately. That is, we will split the domain at some value on the real line, \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc50, and work with the two integrals \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc50 \u2212\u221e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 and \u222b\ufe01 \u221e \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 106 Chapter 1 Integration individually. While any value of \ud835\udc50 \u2208R will suffice, for simplicity, we will state the definition below using \ud835\udc50 = 0. Definition 1.10.5 Type I Improper Integral on (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) Let \ud835\udc53 be integrable on [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] for all \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f\u2208R with \ud835\udc4e \u2264\ud835\udc4f.

REMARK When working with an improper integral of the form \u222b\ufe00\u221e \u2212\u221e\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, it may be tempting to address both limits of integration simultaneously by computing lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61 \u2212\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. (*) Note, however, that this approach is not equivalent to how we have defined \u222b\ufe00\u221e \u2212\u221e\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 in Definition 1.10.5. To see this, consider once again \u222b\ufe00\u221e \u2212\u221esin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. We showed in Exam- ple 1.10.6, this integral was divergent. However, the limit from ( *) leads to a very different Section 1.10 Improper Integrals 107 result. Indeed, since sin \ud835\udc65 is an odd function, \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc61 \u2212\ud835\udc61 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= 0 for all \ud835\udc61, hence lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc61 \u2212\ud835\udc61 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e 0 = 0 The limit in (*) is known as the Cauchy principal value of \u222b\ufe00\u221e \u2212\u221e\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. It has applications in the fields of real and complex analysis. We will not discuss it further in this exposition. Example 1.10.7 Evaluate \u222b\ufe01 \u221e \u2212\u221e 1 1 + \ud835\udc652 if it converges or show that it diverges. Solution: It was shown in Example 1.10.2 that \u222b\ufe000 \u2212\u221e 1 1+\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 is convergent. Specifically, \u222b\ufe01 0 \u2212\u221e 1 1 + \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b 2 . Very similar calculations demonstrate that \u222b\ufe00\u221e 0 1 1+\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 is convergent as well, with \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 0 1 1 + \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b 2 . Consequently, \u222b\ufe00\u221e \u2212\u221e 1 1+\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 is convergent and \u222b\ufe01 \u221e \u2212\u221e 1 1 + \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 0 \u2212\u221e 1 1 + \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 0 1 1 + \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b 2 + \ud835\udf0b 2 = \ud835\udf0b. \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 1+\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 1.10.2 Improper Integrals of Type II We will now consider the problem of integrating a function around an infinite discontinuity (i.e., a vertical asymptote).

The answer is given in the following theorem. Theorem 1.10.10 (Convergence of \ud835\udc5d-Integrals of Type II) If \ud835\udc5d <1, the improper integral \u222b\ufe01 1 0 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 converges and \u222b\ufe01 1 0 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d. If \ud835\udc5d \u22651, the improper integral \u222b\ufe01 1 0 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 diverges. Proof: The integral diverges when \ud835\udc5d = 1, as \u222b\ufe01 1 0 1 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc61 1 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ [ln |\ud835\udc65|]1 \ud835\udc61 = lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ (ln |1|\u2212ln |\ud835\udc61|) = \u221e. Assume now that \ud835\udc5d \u0338= 1. As in the proof of Theorem 1.10.3, we compute \u222b\ufe01 1 0 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 Section 1.10 Improper Integrals 111 = lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ [\ufe02 \ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 ]\ufe021 \ud835\udc61 = lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ (\ufe02 1\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 )\ufe02 = lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ (\ufe02 1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 )\ufe02 .

Thus, the integral converges and has value 1 1\u2212\ud835\udc5d when \ud835\udc5d <1. If instead the exponent \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 is negative (i.e., \ud835\udc5d >1), then lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 = \u221e; hence \u222b\ufe01 1 0 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc61\u21920+ (\ufe02 1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d + 1 )\ufe02 = \u221e.

We summarize our findings in the following theorem. Theorem 1.11.1 (Area Between Curves) Let \ud835\udc53 and \ud835\udc54 be integrable functions defined on [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2265\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], then the area between the graphs of \ud835\udc53 and \ud835\udc54 for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] is given by \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. REMARK Consider the special case in which \ud835\udc54 is the constant function \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = 0. Theorem 1.11.1 asserts that if \ud835\udc53 is integrable on [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] and \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u22650, then \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 represents the area under the graph of \ud835\udc53 and above the \ud835\udc65-axis on [ \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f]. This is exactly the interpretation of the definite integral as the area under a curve that we established in Section 1.1. The basic idea behind Theorem 1.11.1 is the following: the area of a region bounded between an upper curve, \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66upper(\ud835\udc65), and a lower curve, \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66lower(\ud835\udc65) for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] is given by Area = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc66upper(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc66lower(\ud835\udc65)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Let\u2019s now see some examples! Example 1.11.2 Calculate the area between the graphs of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 over each domain. (a) For \ud835\udc65 \u2208[2, 3].

That is, \ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc652 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208[2, 3]. Hence, with \ud835\udc66upper(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 and \ud835\udc66lower(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc65, the area between the graphs is \u222b\ufe01 3 2 (\ud835\udc66upper(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc66lower(\ud835\udc65)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 3 2 (\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 \u2212\ud835\udc65 )\ufe00 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = [\ufe02\ud835\udc653 3 \u2212\ud835\udc652 2 ]\ufe023 2 = (\ufe0233 3 \u221232 2 )\ufe02 \u2212 (\ufe0223 3 \u221222 2 )\ufe02 = 23 6 .

In this example, the curves \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 intersect somewhere in (0 , 3), at which point there is a change in the upper and lower curves.

Thus, we will separately consider the area between the curves for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, 1] and the area between the curves for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[1, 3]. For \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, 1], the graph of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 lies below the graph of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65.

Solution: We begin with a sketch. 118 Chapter 1 Integration \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc652 \u22121 1\u22121 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 The shaded region lies between the points where the two curves intersect. The intersections occur when \ud835\udc652 = 2\ud835\udc652 \u22121, or equivalently, \ud835\udc652 = 1. We therefore have points of intersection at \ud835\udc65 = \u00b11. Within the interval [ \u22121, 1], we see from the figures above that the graph of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 lies above the graph of \ud835\udc66 = 2 \ud835\udc652 \u22121.

As we have seen in the preceding examples, creating a sketch can often be helpful when setting up the integral for the area between curves. It turns out, however, that creating a sketch is not strictly necessary \u2013 we can instead identify the upper and lower curves algebraically. This idea is presented in the following example. Example 1.11.4 Calculate the area between \ud835\udc66 = sin \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 = cos \ud835\udc65 for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, \ud835\udf0b]. Solution: The graphs of \ud835\udc66 = sin \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 = cos \ud835\udc65 intersect when sin \ud835\udc65 = cos \ud835\udc65, which occurs at all points \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b 4 + \ud835\udc58\ud835\udf0b where \ud835\udc58 is an integer. The only such value that lies in the domain [0, \ud835\udf0b] is \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b 4 . For \ud835\udc65 \u2208 [\ufe00 0, \ud835\udf0b 4 ]\ufe00 , we can determine which of \ud835\udc66 = sin \ud835\udc65 or \ud835\udc66 = cos \ud835\udc65 is the upper function by examining which of sin\ud835\udc65 or cos \ud835\udc65 is larger at any sample point from this interval (other than the intersection point of \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b 4 ). At \ud835\udc65 = 0, for instance, we notice that sin 0 = 0 is less than cos 0 = 1; hence \ud835\udc66 = cos \ud835\udc65 is the upper curve on [\ufe00 0, \ud835\udf0b 4 ]\ufe00 , while \ud835\udc66 = sin \ud835\udc65 is the lower curve. Similarly, by substituting \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b (for example) from the interval [\ufe00\ud835\udf0b 4 , \ud835\udf0b ]\ufe00 , we see that sin\ud835\udf0b = 0 and cos \ud835\udf0b = \u22121, hence \ud835\udc66 = sin \ud835\udc65 is the upper curve on this interval while \ud835\udc66 = cos \ud835\udc65 is the lower curve. Section 1.11 Area Between Curves 119 The area between the curves for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, \ud835\udf0b] is therefore Area = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b/4 0 (cos \ud835\udc65 \u2212sin \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udf0b/4 (sin \ud835\udc65 \u2212cos \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = [sin \ud835\udc65 + cos\ud835\udc65]\ud835\udf0b/4 0 + [\u2212cos \ud835\udc65 \u2212sin \ud835\udc65]\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udf0b/4 = (\ufe03\u221a 2 2 + \u221a 2 2 )\ufe03 \u2212(0 + 1) + (\u2212(\u22121) \u22120) \u2212 (\ufe03 \u2212 \u221a 2 2 \u2212 \u221a 2 2 )\ufe03 = 2 \u221a 2.

Throughout this section, we have explored the following basic principle: if a region is bounded between an upper curve, \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66upper(\ud835\udc65), and a lower curve, \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66lower(\ud835\udc65), for \ud835\udc65 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f], then the area of this region is Area = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc66upper(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc66lower(\ud835\udc65)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. In some cases, however, the area may be challenging to describe in terms of upper and lower curves. For example, consider the region below, which is enclosed between the curves \ud835\udc65 = cos \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc65 = 2 + sin\ud835\udc66, with \ud835\udc66-values ranging from \ud835\udc66 = 0 to \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udf0b. 120 Chapter 1 Integration \ud835\udc66 = 0 \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc65 = cos(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc65 = 2 + sin(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 While it is difficult to describe this region as being bounded between an upper curve and a lower curve, we can quite easily describe it as being bounded between a rightmost curve and a leftmost curve. Specifically, the region lies between the rightmost curve \ud835\udc65 = 2 + sin\ud835\udc66 and the leftmost curve \ud835\udc65 = cos \ud835\udc66 with \ud835\udc66 \u2208[0, 2\ud835\udf0b]. Note that these curves are functions of \ud835\udc66. In general, if a region is bounded between a rightmost curve, \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65right(\ud835\udc66), and a leftmost curve, \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65left(\ud835\udc66), for \ud835\udc66 \u2208[\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udc51], then the area of the region can be computed using the following integral with respect to \ud835\udc66: Area = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc65right(\ud835\udc66) \u2212\ud835\udc65left(\ud835\udc66)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66. In our example above, the area of the region is given by Area = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc66=2\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc66=0 (\ud835\udc65right(\ud835\udc66) \u2212\ud835\udc65left(\ud835\udc66)) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 2\ud835\udf0b 0 ((2 + sin\ud835\udc66) \u2212cos \ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = [2\ud835\udc66 \u2212cos \ud835\udc66 \u2212sin \ud835\udc66]2\ud835\udf0b 0 = (4\ud835\udf0b \u22121 \u22120) \u2212(0 \u22121 \u22120) = 4\ud835\udf0b. Example 1.11.5 Determine the area enclosed between the curves \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc66 \u22121, \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc662, \ud835\udc66 = 0, and \ud835\udc66 = 2. Solution: A sketch of the region is given below. Section 1.11 Area Between Curves 121 Notice that the region is bounded between the curve \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc662 on the right and the curve \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc66 \u22121 on the left, with \ud835\udc66-values varying from \ud835\udc66 = 0 and \ud835\udc66 = 2.

Here we are using the positive square root when solving \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc662 for \ud835\udc66 in terms of \ud835\udc65 due to the fact that our region is bounded by a portion of the parabola \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc662 that lies above the \ud835\udc65-axis (i.e., where \ud835\udc66 is positive).

The total area of the shaded region then can be computed by adding the integrals above: Area = \u222b\ufe01 0 \u22121 ((\ud835\udc65 + 1) \u22120) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 1 0 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 + 1) \u2212\u221a\ud835\udc65 )\ufe00 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 + \u222b\ufe01 4 1 (\ufe00 2 \u2212\u221a\ud835\udc65 )\ufe00 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

Section 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution 123 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution In this section, we will modify our approach for calculating the area under a curve to deter- mine the volume of certain three-dimensional solids. We will focus on computing volumes of solids of revolution, solids obtained by revolving a two-dimensional region about an axis. Computing volumes of more general solids typically requires methods from multivariable calculus, which is beyond the scope of our study. We will explore two methods for calculating volumes of solids of revolution: one in which we \u201cslice\u201d the solid into disks or washers and another in which we decompose the solid into cylindrical shells. 1.12.1 Volumes by Disks and Washers Consider a region \ud835\udc45 that lies below the graph of a continuous function \ud835\udc53, above the \ud835\udc65-axis, and between the vertical lines \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f. If this region is revolved about the \ud835\udc65-axis in three-dimensional space, a solid figure is produced. A solid formed in this way is called a solid of revolution . 124 Chapter 1 Integration To determine the volume of this solid, \ud835\udc49 , let us think back to how we tackled a similar problem: finding the area under a curve. Our solution to the area problem was to divide the \ud835\udc65-axis into small subintervals of width \u2206 \ud835\udc65 and approximate the area on each subinterval using the area of a rectangle. To adapt this approach to calculate the volume of our solid of revolution, let\u2019s again start with a partition of the interval [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] into subintervals of equal width, \u2206\ud835\udc65. Let the endpoints of these subintervals be given by \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 < \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4f. On each subinterval [ \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56], consider a rectangle of width \u2206 \ud835\udc65 and height \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56). If we imagine each of these rectangles revolving about the\ud835\udc65-axis, we obtain a collection of circular disks that approximate the shape of our solid. The volume of our solid can be approximated as the sum of the volumes of these disks. To this end, let \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56 denote the volume of the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e disk. If \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) denotes the area of the disk\u2019s circular face\u2013or, equivalently, the area of the cross section of the solid at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u2014then we Section 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution 125 can calculate \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56 by multiplying \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) by the thickness",

Let us now see how this process for calculating volumes\u2014which is commonly referred to as the disk method \u2014can be used in practice! Example 1.12.1 Let \ud835\udc45 denote the region that lies below the graph of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652, above the \ud835\udc65-axis, and between the lines \ud835\udc65 = 0 and \ud835\udc65 = 2. Determine the volume of the solid obtained by revolving \ud835\udc45 about the \ud835\udc65-axis. Solution: A sketch of the region is shown below along with one of its cross sections. 126 Chapter 1 Integration radius The area of the cross section at each \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, 2] is given by \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf0b (radius)2 = \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc652)2 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc654. Hence, the volume of the solid is \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 2 0 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 2 0 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b [\ufe02\ud835\udc655 5 ]\ufe022 0 = \ud835\udf0b (\ufe0225 5 \u221205 5 )\ufe02 = 32\ud835\udf0b 5 . Example 1.12.2 Show that the volume of a sphere of radius \ud835\udc5f is 4 3 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f3.

For instance, consider the region \ud835\udc45 shown below and the solid of revolution obtained by revolving \ud835\udc45 about the \ud835\udc65-axis. Notice that the cross sections of this solid are not disks \u2013 they are washers. A washer is a disk with a smaller concentric disk removed, as shown below. (The term \u201cwasher\u201d is commonly used outside of mathematics. In construction, a washer refers to a metal plate with a hole used to distribute weight.) 128 Chapter 1 Integration [Washer] - Paul Taylor/Stone via Getty Images If \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) denotes the area of the cross section obtained by slicing the solid at each value \ud835\udc65, then we can still compute the volume of the solid using the formula \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Since \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) now represents the area of a washer and not of a disk, it is given by the formula \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf0b (\ud835\udc5fouter)2 \u2212\ud835\udf0b (\ud835\udc5finner)2 . Here, \ud835\udc5fouter is the outer radius, the distance from the axis of rotation to the outer edge of the washer. Likewise, \ud835\udc5finner is the inner radius, the distance from the axis of rotation to the inner edge of the washer. When the cross sections of a solid are washers, we sometimes refer to the above process of calculating the volume of the solid as the washer method . Observe that the disk method is a special case of the washer method in which \ud835\udc5finner = 0. Example 1.12.3 Let \ud835\udc45 denote the region enclosed between the graphs of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 and \ud835\udc66 = \u221a\ud835\udc65.

Section 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution 129 The region lies between the \ud835\udc65-values at which the curves \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 and \ud835\udc66 = \u221a\ud835\udc65 intersect. These intersections occur when \u221a\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc652, or equivalently when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc654. Hence, solving the equation \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc654 = \ud835\udc65(1 \u2212\ud835\udc653) = 0, we find that the intersections occur when \ud835\udc65 = 0 or \ud835\udc65 = 1. These will be the bounds of our integral. Observe that the cross section obtained by slicing the solid at each \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, 1] is a washer. From our picture above, we see that the outer radius of the washer is given by the height of the square root function, so \ud835\udc5fouter = \u221a\ud835\udc65. Likewise, its inner radius is given by the height of the parabola, so \ud835\udc5finner = \ud835\udc652. Thus, the area of the washer is \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf0b (\ud835\udc5fouter)2 \u2212\ud835\udf0b (\ud835\udc5finner)2 = \ud835\udf0b (\ufe00\u221a\ud835\udc65 )\ufe002 \u2212\ud835\udf0b (\ufe00 \ud835\udc652)\ufe002 = \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc654), and hence the volume of the solid is \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udf0b (\ufe00 \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc654)\ufe00 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b [\ufe02\ud835\udc652 2 \u2212\ud835\udc655 5 ]\ufe021 0 = \ud835\udf0b (\ufe021 2 \u22121 5 )\ufe02 \u2212\ud835\udf0b (\ufe020 2 \u22120 5 )\ufe02 = 3\ud835\udf0b 10 . Sometimes we may wish to revolve a region about a horizontal line that is not the \ud835\udc65-axis. We follow the same approach for calculating the volume of the resulting solid: integrate the cross sectional area, \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc5f2 outer) \u2212\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc5finner)2. As we will see in the next example, we will just need a bit more care when finding expressions for \ud835\udc5fouter and \ud835\udc5finner in terms of \ud835\udc65. 130 Chapter 1 Integration Example 1.12.4 Let \ud835\udc45 denote the region that lies between the graphs of \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 2 . Set up an integral that represents the volume of the solid obtained by revolving \ud835\udc45 about the given axis. (a) About the line \ud835\udc66 = \u22121. Solution: A sketch of the region\ud835\udc45 and a typical cross section of the solid of revolution are shown below. The region lies between the \ud835\udc65-values at which the curves \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 2 intersect.

Solution: Once again, we sketch the region \ud835\udc45 and a typical cross section of the solid of revolution. As in (a), we will be considering cross sections of the solid at each \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, 4]. Section 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution 131 This time, we see each cross section is a washer with outer radius \ud835\udc5fouter = 9 \u2212\ud835\udc652 2 and inner radius \ud835\udc5finner = 9 \u22122\ud835\udc65. Consequently, the volume of the solid is \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 4 0 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 4 0 (\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b (\ud835\udc5fouter)2 \u2212\ud835\udf0b (\ud835\udc5finner)2 )\ufe01 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 4 0 (\ufe03 \ud835\udf0b (\ufe02 9 \u2212\ud835\udc652 2 )\ufe022 \u2212\ud835\udf0b (9 \u22122\ud835\udc65)2 )\ufe03 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. It is also possible to generate a solid of revolution by revolving a region about a vertical axis. 132 Chapter 1 Integration In this case, however, the cross sections of the solid are obtained by slicing the solid perpen- dicular to the \ud835\udc66-axis \u2013 not perpendicular to the \ud835\udc65-axis as in earlier examples. The volume of the solid will therefore be calculated as as an integral with respect to \ud835\udc66: \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66, where \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc66) represents the area of a cross section of the solid at each value \ud835\udc66. Example 1.12.5 Let \ud835\udc45 denote the region between the graphs of \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 2 . Determine the volume of the solid obtained by revolving \ud835\udc45 about the \ud835\udc66-axis. Solution: A sketch of the region and a typical cross section of the solid are shown below. We see from the picture that \ud835\udc45 extends vertically between the \ud835\udc66-values at which \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 2 intersect. As we saw in Example 1.12.4, these intersections occur when \ud835\udc65 = 0 or \ud835\udc65 = 4. Substituting these values into either \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc65 or \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 2 , we obtain the corresponding \ud835\udc66-values of \ud835\udc66 = 0 and \ud835\udc66 = 8.

Substituting these values into either \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc65 or \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 2 , we obtain the corresponding \ud835\udc66-values of \ud835\udc66 = 0 and \ud835\udc66 = 8. These will be the limits of integration. At each \ud835\udc66 in [0, 8], the cross section of the solid is a washer with outer radius given by the \ud835\udc65-value of the function \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 2 . Solving for \ud835\udc65 in terms of \ud835\udc66, we have \ud835\udc65 = \u221a2\ud835\udc66. Note that we are using the positive root for \ud835\udc65 since the region lies entirely to the right of the \ud835\udc66-axis (i.e., where \ud835\udc65 is positive). Hence, \ud835\udc5fouter = \u221a2\ud835\udc66. Likewise, the inner radius of the washer is the \ud835\udc65-value of the function \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc65. Solving for \ud835\udc65 in terms of \ud835\udc66, we have \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc66 2 , hence \ud835\udc5finner = \ud835\udc66 2 . Therefore, the volume of the solid is \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 8 0 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 Section 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution 133 = \u222b\ufe01 8 0 (\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b (\ud835\udc5fouter)2 \u2212\ud835\udf0b (\ud835\udc5finner)2 )\ufe01 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 8 0 (\ufe02 \ud835\udf0b (\ufe01\u221a\ufe00 2\ud835\udc66 )\ufe012 \u2212\ud835\udf0b (\ufe01\ud835\udc66 2 )\ufe012)\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 8 0 \ud835\udf0b (\ufe02 2\ud835\udc66 \u2212\ud835\udc662 4 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udf0b [\ufe02 \ud835\udc662 \u2212\ud835\udc663 12 ]\ufe028 0 = 64\ud835\udf0b 3 . REMARK The solid obtained by revolving a region about the \ud835\udc66-axis need not have the same volume as the solid obtained by revolving the same region about the\ud835\udc65-axis. Indeed, when the region \ud835\udc45 in Example 1.12.5 is revolved about the \ud835\udc66-axis, the resulting solid (below, left) was shown to have volume 64\ud835\udf0b 3 \u224867.02. If instead this region \ud835\udc45 is rotated about the \ud835\udc65-axis, the resulting solid (below, right) will turn out to have a much larger volume of 512\ud835\udf0b 15 \u2248107.23. You are encouraged to verify the volume calculation about the \ud835\udc65-axis as an exercise! We have just seen that it is necessary to work with functions of \ud835\udc66 when using the disk or washer method to compute the volume of a solid of revolution about a vertical axis. Of course, it is sometimes quite challenging\u2014or perhaps even impossible\u2014to express a function \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) in the form \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc66). As such, the disk or washer method may not always be practical. For instance, consider the region between the graph of \ud835\udc66 = sin(\ud835\udc65) and the \ud835\udc65-axis from \ud835\udc65 = 0 to \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b. When this region is revolved about the \ud835\udc66-axis, we obtain the solid shown below. 134 Chapter 1 Integration Since we have revolved our region about a vertical axis, the volume of the solid is given by",

When this region is revolved about the \ud835\udc66-axis, we obtain the solid shown below. 134 Chapter 1 Integration Since we have revolved our region about a vertical axis, the volume of the solid is given by an integral with respect to \ud835\udc66. Setting up this integral is a formidable task, however, as the function \ud835\udc66 = sin \ud835\udc65 is not one-to-one on the interval [0 , \ud835\udf0b] and hence cannot be expressed in the form \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc66). Fortunately, there is another method for calculating volumes that can help in situations like the one described above. This method involves decomposing a solid into a collection of cylindrical shells. Let\u2019s see how it works! 1.12.2 Volumes by Cylindrical Shells Once again, consider a region \ud835\udc45 that lies below the graph of a continuous function \ud835\udc53, above the \ud835\udc65-axis, and between the vertical lines \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f. This time, we will begin by studying the three-dimensional solid obtained by revolving \ud835\udc45 about the \ud835\udc66-axis! To compute the volume of this solid,\ud835\udc49 , let us begin with a partition of [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f] into subintervals of equal width, \u2206 \ud835\udc65. Let \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc650 < \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4f denote the endpoints of the intervals. On each subinterval [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56], consider a rectangle of width \u2206\ud835\udc65 and height \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56). When these rectangles are revolved about the \ud835\udc66-axis, they form a collection of cylindrical shells that approximate the shape of the solid. The volume of the solid can therefore be approximated by adding the volumes of these cylindrical shells. Section 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution 135 If \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56 denotes the volume of the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e shell, then \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56 is approximately equal to the surface area of the outside of the shell \u2013 which we will denote by \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) \u2013 multiplied by the shell\u2019s thickness, \u2206\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b : \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56 \u2248\ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)\u2206\ud835\udc65. Since the outside of each shell is a cylinder with radius\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 and height \u210e = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56), the area of this cylinder is \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) = 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\u210e = 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56), the circumference of the cylinder multiplied by its height. The volume of the solid can therefore be approximated as \ud835\udc49 \u2248 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56 \u2248 \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)\u2206\ud835\udc65, and the exact volume can be obtained by computing the limit of the right-hand side as the number of shells, \ud835\udc5b, approaches infinity. We recognize this limit as a definite integral.

This approach to calculating volumes is known as the method of cylindrical shells . We are now prepared to revisit the problem discussed at the end of Section 1.12 that proved too challenging to solve using disks and washers. Example 1.12.6 Let \ud835\udc45 denote the region that lies below the graph of\ud835\udc66 = sin \ud835\udc65, above the \ud835\udc65-axis, and between the vertical lines \ud835\udc65 = 0 and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b. Determine the volume of the solid obtained by revolving \ud835\udc45 about the \ud835\udc66-axis. Solution: We will use the method of cylindrical shells. The region \ud835\udc45 is shown below along with a typical shell drawn at some \ud835\udc65 \u2208[0, \ud835\udf0b]. The surface area of a typical shell is \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) = 2 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\u210e, where \ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc65 is the radius of the shell and \u210e = sin \ud835\udc65 is its height. Thus, the volume of the solid is \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b 0 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b 0 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\u210e \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= 2\ud835\udf0b \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b 0 \ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. We will evaluate this integral using integration by parts with \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = sin \ud835\udc65. We compute \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 1, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \u2212cos \ud835\udc65, and therefore \ud835\udc49 = 2\ud835\udf0b \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b 0 \ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 2\ud835\udf0b (\ufe02 [\u2212\ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65]\ud835\udf0b 0 \u2212 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b 0 (\u2212cos \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 )\ufe02 = 2\ud835\udf0b (\u2212[\ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65]\ud835\udf0b 0 + [sin\ud835\udc65]\ud835\udf0b 0 ) = 2\ud835\udf0b (\u2212(\ud835\udf0b cos \ud835\udf0b \u22120 cos 0) + (sin\ud835\udf0b \u2212sin 0)) = 2\ud835\udf0b2. We are now ready to explore how the method of cylindrical shells can be used in some (slightly) more complicated situations. Specifically, we will consider regions bounded be- Section 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution 137 tween multiple curves, rather than between a single curve and the \ud835\udc65-axis. We will also consider revolutions about axes other than the \ud835\udc66-axis.

These occur when \u221a\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65 3 or, equivalently, when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc652 9 , so 9\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc652.",

The surface area of the shell is therefore given by \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) = 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\u210e = 2\ud835\udf0b(2 + \ud835\udc65) (\ufe01\u221a\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc65 3 )\ufe01 , and hence the volume of the solid is \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 9 0 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 9 0 2\ud835\udf0b(2 + \ud835\udc65) (\ufe01\u221a\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc65 3 )\ufe01 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. (c) The line \ud835\udc65 = 10. Solution: The sketch of \ud835\udc45 is shown below along with a typical cylindrical shell. This time, each shell has radius \ud835\udc5f = 10 \u2212\ud835\udc65 and height \u210e = \u221a\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc65 3 . The surface area of the shell is therefore given by \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) = 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\u210e = 2\ud835\udf0b(10 \u2212\ud835\udc65) (\ufe01\u221a\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc65 3 )\ufe01 , Section 1.12 Volumes of Solids of Revolution 139 and hence the volume of the solid is \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 9 0 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 9 0 2\ud835\udf0b(10 \u2212\ud835\udc65) (\ufe01\u221a\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc65 3 )\ufe01 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

Example 1.12.8 Let \ud835\udc45 denote the region that lies below the graph of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652, above the \ud835\udc65-axis, and between the lines \ud835\udc65 = 0 and \ud835\udc65 = 2. Using the method of cylindrical shells, determine the volume of the solid obtained by revolving \ud835\udc45 about the \ud835\udc65-axis. 140 Chapter 1 Integration Solution: Since our solid is created by revolving\ud835\udc45 about a horizontal axis, we will consider cylindrical shells at each value of \ud835\udc66. For the limits of integration, observe that \ud835\udc65 varies from \ud835\udc65 = 0 to \ud835\udc65 = 2; hence, substituting these values into the function \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652, we see that \ud835\udc66 varies from \ud835\udc66 = 0 to \ud835\udc66 = 4. At each \ud835\udc66 \u2208[0, 4], we see from the picture that the cylindrical shell has a radius of \ud835\udc66. The height of the shell is given by the horizontal distance between the graph of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 and the line \ud835\udc65 = 2. Writing \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 as \ud835\udc65 = \u221a\ud835\udc66, the height of the shell is \u210e = 2 \u2212\u221a\ud835\udc66, the \ud835\udc65-value from the rightmost curve minus the \ud835\udc65-value from the leftmost curve. The surface area of a typical shell is therefore given by \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc66) = 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\u210e = 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc66 (2 \u2212\u221a\ud835\udc66) , and hence the volume of the solid is \ud835\udc49 = \u222b\ufe01 4 0 \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 4 0 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc66 (2 \u2212\u221a\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udf0b \u222b\ufe01 4 0 (\ufe01 2\ud835\udc66 \u2212\ud835\udc663/2 )\ufe01 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udf0b [\ufe02 \ud835\udc662 \u22122 5\ud835\udc665/2 ]\ufe02 = 2\ud835\udf0b (\ufe02 42 \u22122 5 45/2 )\ufe02 \u22122\ud835\udf0b (\ufe02 02 \u22122 5 05/2 )\ufe02 = 32\ud835\udf0b 5 .

We end this section with a summary of the two methods for calculating volumes of solids of revolution and some guidance on when each method can be used.

Chapter 2 Differential Equations The study of differential equations is among the most important applications of calculus to science and engineering. Differential equations are used to model a wide range of continu- ously changing or evolving process, including: \u2022 transfer of heat through an object; \u2022 vibrations of a guitar string; \u2022 propagation of light, sound, or ocean waves; \u2022 movement of celestial bodies; \u2022 changing financial markets; \u2022 population growth and decay; \u2022 spread of infectious disease; \u2022 chemical reactions; and many more. The theory of differential equations is vast and comprises an entire branch of mathematics of its own. While we will only scratch the surface of the field here, this chapter serves as an introduction to some of the terminology and techniques that one may explore further in later courses. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to \u2022 state key definitions related to the study of differential equations; \u2022 recognize and solve simple types of differential equations; \u2022 use differential equations to model changes in temperature, population growth, and radioactive decay. 144 Section 2.1 Introduction to Differential Equations 145 2.1 Introduction to Differential Equations First, let us define",

Definition 2.1.1 Differential Equation A differential equation (DE), is an equation involving an unknown function and its deriva- tives. The term ordinary differential equation (ODE) refers to a differential equation involv- ing single-variable functions, whereas the termpartial differential equation (PDE) refers to a differential equation involving multivariable functions (i.e., functions with multiple inputs). This chapter will focus solely on ordinary differential equations. Partial differential equa- tions are beyond the scope of our study. An ODE (or simply DE from this point onward) of an unknown function \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) is therefore an equation of the form \ud835\udc39 (\ufe01 \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66\u2032, \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032, . . . , \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc5b) )\ufe01 = 0 for some \ud835\udc5b \u2208N. Definition 2.1.2 Order of a DE The order of a DE is the order of the highest derivative that appears in the equation. Example 2.1.3 (a) The differential equation \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc66 has order 1. It describes all functions \ud835\udc66 that are equal to their own first derivative. (b) The differential equation \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 also has order 1, since it involves a first derivative but no derivatives of higher orders. (c) The differential equation \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc512\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1 has order 2. (d) The differential equation (\ufe00 \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032\u2032)\ufe001/3 + \ud835\udc66 (\ufe00 \ud835\udc66\u2032)\ufe007 \u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc66\u2032 = \ud835\udc65 has order 3. Definition 2.1.4 Solution to a DE, Solution Curve A function \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc65) is a solution to the differential equation \ud835\udc39 (\ufe00 \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66\u2032, \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032, . . . , \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc5b))\ufe00 = 0 if \ud835\udc39 (\ufe01 \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udf19\u2032(\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udf19\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc65), . . . , \ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc65) )\ufe01 = 0. The graph of a solution to a DE is called a solution curve. Solving a differential equation can be challenging, but it is usually not too hard to verify whether or not a given function is a solution. 146 Chapter 2 Differential Equations Example 2.1.5 Show that the function \ud835\udc66 = \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1 is a solution to the DE \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2212\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 = 0. Solution: We will verify that with \ud835\udc66 = \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1, the left-hand side of this DE is equal to the right-hand side. We have \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2212\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 = (\ufe01\u221a\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 + 1 )\ufe01\u2032 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1 = 2\ud835\udc65 2 \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1 (by the chain rule) = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc652 + 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1",

Since \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2212\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 = 0, the function \ud835\udc66 = \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1 is indeed a solution. In the coming sections, we will explore general strategies for solving certain types of first- order DEs. For now, let\u2019s investigate some simple examples. Example 2.1.6 The differential equation \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc652 \u22121 has order 1. It describes all functions \ud835\udc66 with first derivative equal to \ud835\udc652 \u22121. This DE is straightforward to solve: we can use integration! \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc652 \u22121 = \u21d2 \ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 \u22121 )\ufe00 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653 3 \u2212\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36, \ud835\udc36 \u2208R Example 2.1.7 Consider the differential equation \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc66. Unlike in the previous example, we cannot simply solve this DE by integrating both sides with respect to \ud835\udc65. We may recognize, however, that since \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 is known to be equal to its derivative, \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 is a solution to the DE. There are other solutions as well. Examples include \ud835\udc66 = 2 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66 = \u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, and, in general, \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. It turns out that this collection comprises all of the infinitely many solutions to the DE. We will soon be able to show this rigorously using the techniques from Section 2.2. Section 2.1 Introduction to Differential Equations 147 REMARK One of the solutions to the DE \ud835\udc66\u2032 = \ud835\udc66 from the last example is the constant zero func- tion. Mathematicians sometimes use the notation \ud835\udc66 \u22610 when describing the constant zero function, or, more generally, \ud835\udc66 \u2261\ud835\udc36 when describing the constant function with value \ud835\udc36. This notations helps us to distinguish between a function \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) that is equal to a certain constant \ud835\udc36 for some values of \ud835\udc65 versus the function that is equal to \ud835\udc36 for all values of \ud835\udc65. Definition 2.1.8 General Solution, Particular Solution The complete collection of solutions to a DE, including any arbitrary constants, is called its general solution. A particular solution to a DE is one in which all arbitrary constants have been specified. As discussed in Example 2.1.7, the general solution to the DE \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc66 is \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. By selecting a value of \ud835\udc36, we obtain a particular solution to the DE. For instance, \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 is a particular solution to the DE obtained by setting \ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udf0b.

One can specify particular solutions \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) to a DE by stipulating the value of \ud835\udc66 or one or more of its derivatives at some \ud835\udc650. These are called initial conditions. Definition 2.1.9 Initial Value Problem A differential equation together with one or more initial conditions is known as an initial value problem or IVP. Example 2.1.10 Given that the general solution to the DE \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc66 is \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 with \ud835\udc36 \u2208R, solve the initial value problem \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66 (1) = 2\ud835\udc52. Solution: We are asked to identify the particular solution(s) \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 that satisfy the initial condition \ud835\udc66(1) = 2 \ud835\udc52, or, equivalently, that pass through the point ( \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) = (1 , 2\ud835\udc52). Substituting \ud835\udc65 = 1 and \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc52, we find that \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 2\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc521 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc36 = 2. 148 Chapter 2 Differential Equations Hence, \ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 is the one and only particular solution to the IVP \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66(1) = 2\ud835\udc52. Example 2.1.11 The general solution to the second-order differential equation \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032= \u2212\ud835\udc66 is \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc34 sin(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc35 cos(\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35 \u2208R.

Additionally, when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf0b 4 , we require that \ud835\udc66\u2032 = \u221a 2.

The specific first-order DEs we will consider can all be expressed in the form \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66). (Eq. 1) Even DEs of this simplistic form cannot always be solved analytically. That is, it is not always possible to find exact solutions expressed in terms of elementary functions. Often, however, we can still learn a lot about the DE by taking a graphical approach. Indeed, the DE in Eq. 1 tells us the slope of the tangent line to its solution curves at each point (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66). We can visualize these slopes in a 2D plot known as a direction field. Section 2.1 Introduction to Differential Equations 149 Example 2.1.12 Consider the DE \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 . Without actually solving the DE, we can immediately say that if \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) is a solution to the DE passing through the point (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) = (1, 2), for example, then the slope of the tangent line to \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) at (1, 2) is \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 = 1 2. We can represent the slope at (1, 2) graphically by plotting a small line segment with slope 1/2 at this point. The table below shows other sample points and the corresponding slope of the solution curves that pass through them: (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) (0, 1) (1 , 1) ( \u22121, 1) (2 , 1) (3 , 1) (2 , 3) (1 , 0) slope = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 0 1 \u22121 2 3 2 3 undefined Each slope we have computed so far is shown below at the corresponding point ( \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66).

The DE may not appear to be too complicated (after all, it only involves positive integer powers of \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66), but it turns out this DE cannot be solved analytically for exact solutions. Still, we can plot its direction field to get an idea of what the solution curves would need to look like. From the direction field, it appears that all the solution curves are increasing functions of \ud835\udc65. We can see from the DE that this must be the case. Indeed, if \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) is a solution, Section 2.1 Introduction to Differential Equations 151 then the derivative of \ud835\udc66 is equal to \ud835\udc652\ud835\udc662 + 1, which is positive. Since \ud835\udc66\u2032(\ud835\udc65) > 0 for all \ud835\udc65, it follows that \ud835\udc66 is an increasing function. Section 2.1 Problems 2.1.1. Determine the order of the following differential equations. (a) \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032+ \ud835\udc66 = 2 (b) ( \ud835\udc66\u2032)2 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc66 (c) \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032\u2032\ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032+ \ud835\udc66 \u2212\ud835\udc652 = 0 2.1.2. Determine all real values of \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f such that \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc4f is a solution to the differential equation (\ud835\udc66\u2032)2 = \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc66. 2.1.3. (a) For what values of \ud835\udc58 \u2208R does the function \ud835\udc66 = cos(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61) satisfy the differential equation 4\ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032= \u221225\ud835\udc66? (b) For the values of \ud835\udc58 that you found in part (a), verify that every member of the family of functions \ud835\udc34 sin(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udc35 cos(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35\u2208R is also a solution. 2.1.4. Explain why a non-constant solution to the differential equation \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc66 \u22121)2 is never decreasing. What are the constant solutions? 2.1.5. Sketch a direction field for the following differential equations. (a) \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc65 (b) \ud835\udc66\u2032= \u2212\ud835\udc66 (c) \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc66 \u2212\ud835\udc65 (d) \ud835\udc66\u2032= \ud835\udc66 \u2212\ud835\udc652 152 Chapter 2 Differential Equations 2.2 Separable Differential Equations Here we will explore a technique for solving first-order differential equations of a specific form.

Indeed, we may rewrite the equation as \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = sin(\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66) \u2212sin(\ud835\udc65) cos(\ud835\udc66) = [sin(\ud835\udc65) cos(\ud835\udc66) + cos(\ud835\udc65) sin(\ud835\udc66)] \u2212sin(\ud835\udc65) cos(\ud835\udc66) = cos(\ud835\udc65) sin(\ud835\udc66). Since the non-derivative terms can be written of the form\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)\u210e(\ud835\udc66), the equation is separable. Example 2.2.4 Both \ud835\udc66\u2032 = \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 are examples of non-separable DEs. The non-derivative terms cannot be written in the form \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)\u210e(\ud835\udc66). 2.2.1 Solving a Separable DE Consider a separable differential equation \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)\u210e(\ud835\udc66). Provided \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \u0338\u22610, we may rewrite the DE as 1 \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65). Section 2.2 Separable Differential Equations 153 Since we wish to determine the solution(s) \ud835\udc66, we will attempt to remove the derivative term by integrating both sides of the equation with respect to \ud835\udc65: \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe02 1 \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Since \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, the integral on the left-hand side can be written simply as \u222b\ufe00 1 \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66, leading to the integral equation \u222b\ufe01 1 \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Given specific functions \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) and \u210e(\ud835\udc66), we will evaluate the integrals on each side of the equation above, leading to an equation with no derivative terms remaining. Provided this equation is not too complicated, we can then isolate for \ud835\udc66 in terms of \ud835\udc65. Observe that the strategy above relies on the assumption that \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \u0338\u22610. In some cases, there may also be solutions where \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \u22610, which must be considered separately. We summarize the general strategy as follows. Method Solving a Separable DE Below we present the steps to solve a separable differential equation, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)\u210e(\ud835\udc66). This method is known as separation of variables. 1. Determine any solutions \ud835\udc66 with \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \u22610. 2. Find the solutions \ud835\udc66 where \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \u0338\u22610 by evaluating the integrals \u222b\ufe01 1 \u210e(\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. If possible, isolate \ud835\udc66 as a function of \ud835\udc65 in the resulting equation. The general solution is the collection of all solutions obtained in Step 1 together with all solutions obtained in Step 2.

Solution: First, note that \u210e(\ud835\udc66) = 1 \ud835\udc66 can never be 0. Multiplying both sides of the DE by \ud835\udc66, separating the differentials, and integrating, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66= \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, and hence \ud835\udc662 2 + \ud835\udc361 = \ud835\udc652 2 + \ud835\udc362.

REMARKS (i) In Example 2.2.5, it was ultimately not necessary to introduce two constants \ud835\udc361 and \ud835\udc362 when integrating. Indeed, these constants could be grouped into a single constant on the right-hand side of the equation. Since this will always be the case, we will introduce an arbitrary constant on just one side of the equation from now on. (ii) In the general solution to the DE from Examples 2.2.5, by considering the positive square root and setting \ud835\udc36 = 1, we obtain the particular solution \ud835\udc66 = \u221a \ud835\udc652 + 1.

Example 2.2.8 Solve the initial value problem \ud835\udc66\u2032= 4\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc66 \u22121), \ud835\udc66 (0) = 3. Solution: The DE is separable with \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = 4\ud835\udc65 and \u210e(\ud835\udc66) = \ud835\udc66 \u22121. Note that \u210e(\ud835\udc66) = \ud835\udc66 \u22121 \u22610 when \ud835\udc66 \u22611; however, the function \ud835\udc66 \u22611 cannot be a solution to the IVP since it does not satisfy the initial condition \ud835\udc66(0) = 3. The remaining solutions to DE can be obtained through separating and integrating: \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc66 \u22121 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 4\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 ln |\ud835\udc66 \u22121|= 2\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc36 =\u21d2 |\ud835\udc66 \u22121|= \ud835\udc522\ud835\udc652+\ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc522\ud835\udc652 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc66 \u22121 = \u00b1\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc522\ud835\udc652 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc66 = 1 + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc522\ud835\udc652 , where \ud835\udc37 = \u00b1\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36 is a (non-zero) constant. 156 Chapter 2 Differential Equations Finally, we solve for \ud835\udc37 using the initial condition \ud835\udc66(0) = 3: \ud835\udc66 = 1 + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc522\ud835\udc652 and \ud835\udc66(0) = 3 = \u21d2 3 = 1 + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc522(0)2 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc37 = 2. Thus, \ud835\udc66 = 1 + 2\ud835\udc522\ud835\udc652 is the particular solution to the IVP. 2.2.2 Solving a Differential Equation by Substitution Some non-separable DEs can be transformed into separable DEs using a substitution/change of variable. Example 2.2.9 Find the general solution to the non-separable DE \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = (\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66)2 \u22121 using the substitution \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66. Solution: With \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66, we have \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc63 \u2212\ud835\udc65, and hence \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65",

Thus, \ud835\udc66 = 1 + 2\ud835\udc522\ud835\udc652 is the particular solution to the IVP. 2.2.2 Solving a Differential Equation by Substitution Some non-separable DEs can be transformed into separable DEs using a substitution/change of variable. Example 2.2.9 Find the general solution to the non-separable DE \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = (\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66)2 \u22121 using the substitution \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66. Solution: With \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66, we have \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc63 \u2212\ud835\udc65, and hence \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc63 \u2212\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u22121. The DE can therefore be rewritten as \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = (\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66)2 \u22121 = \u21d2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u22121 = \ud835\udc632 \u22121 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc632, which is a separable DE in terms of \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc63. One solution is \ud835\udc63 \u22610. For \ud835\udc63 \u0338\u22610, we have \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc632 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63 = \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \u22121 \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc63 = \u22121 \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36 . Of course, we are ultimately interested in the functions \ud835\udc66 that satisfy the original DE. We can obtain these functions from the solutions \ud835\udc63 found above using the relationship \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc63\u2212\ud835\udc65. Specifically, \ud835\udc63 \u22610 = \u21d2 \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc63 \u2212\ud835\udc65 = \u2212\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc63 = \u22121 \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc63 \u2212\ud835\udc65 = \u22121 \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36 \u2212\ud835\udc65. Thus, the general solution to \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = (\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc662) \u22121 is \ud835\udc66 = \u2212\ud835\udc65 or \ud835\udc66 = \u22121 \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36 \u2212\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. Note that \ud835\udc66 = \u2212\ud835\udc65 is a singular solution, as it is not among the solutions \ud835\udc66 = \u22121 \ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc36 \u2212\ud835\udc65 for any \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. Section 2.2 Separable Differential Equations 157 For more practice with solving differential equations by substitution, see Exercise 2.2.3 at the end of this section. 2.2.3 An Application: Mixing Problems Imagine a tank filled with a thoroughly-mixed solution (e.g., brine, sugar water, etc.) at some initial level of concentration. The solution drains from the tank at a certain rate and, at the same time, more of the solution is pumped into the tank at a certain (possibly different) rate. The incoming solution may have a different concentration than the solution in the tank initially. If \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) denotes the amount of solute (e.g, salt, sugar, etc.) present in the tank at time \ud835\udc61, then the rate of change of \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) with respect to \ud835\udc61 is equal to the rate at which the substance enters the tank minus the rate at which the substance leaves the tank. This observation can be used to construct a separable DE to model the scenario: \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = (\ufe02 rate of substance in )\ufe02 \u2212 (\ufe02 rate of substance out )\ufe02 . Solving this DE, we can determine the amount of substance in the tank at any given time. Example 2.2.10 A tank contains 1000 L of salt water at an initial concentration of 0 .1",

Solving this DE, we can determine the amount of substance in the tank at any given time. Example 2.2.10 A tank contains 1000 L of salt water at an initial concentration of 0 .1 kg/L. Salt water of concentration 0.3 kg/L is pumped into the tank at a rate of 10 L /min. The solution is kept well-mixed and drains out at the same rate. (a) Determine the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time. Solution: If \ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) denotes the amount of salt in the tank in kilograms after \ud835\udc61 minutes, then \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = (\ufe02 rate of salt in )\ufe02 \u2212 (\ufe02 rate of salt out )\ufe02 = \ud835\udc45in \u2212\ud835\udc45out. 158 Chapter 2 Differential Equations The rate of salt into the tank is \ud835\udc45in = (\ufe02 concentration of salt in )\ufe02(\ufe02 rate of flow in )\ufe02 = (0.3 kg/L) (10 L/min) = 3 kg/min. To find the rate of salt out of the tank, we will similarly need to multiply the con- centration of salt at time \ud835\udc61 by the rate of flow of salt water out of the tank. Since the rate of flow in and rate of flow out are equal, the volume of liquid in the tank is constant through this process and equal to 1000 L. The concentration at time \ud835\udc61 can therefore be calculated as concentration at time t = amount of salt at time \ud835\udc61 volume at time \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc34 1000 kg/L. Thus, \ud835\udc45out = (\ufe02 concentration at time t )\ufe02(\ufe02 rate of flow out )\ufe02 = (\ufe02 \ud835\udc34 1000 kg/L )\ufe02 (10 L/min) = \ud835\udc34 100 kg/min. We therefore obtain the DE \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc45in \u2212\ud835\udc45out = 3 \u2212 \ud835\udc34 100, which we will solve for \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61). This separable DE can be written as \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u22121 100 (\ud835\udc34 \u2212300), or, in differential form, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc34 \u2212300 = \u22121 100 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61. Integrating, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc34 \u2212300 = \u222b\ufe01 \u22121 100 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 =\u21d2 ln |\ud835\udc34 \u2212300|= \u2212\ud835\udc61 100 + \ud835\udc36 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc34 \u2212300 = \u00b1\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc61/100+\ud835\udc36 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc34 = 300 + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc61/100 (where \ud835\udc35 = \u00b1\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36.) At time \ud835\udc61 = 0, the tank contains (0 .1 kg/L) (1000 L) = 100 kg of salt, hence \ud835\udc34(0) = 100. Using this initial condition, we may solve for \ud835\udc35 as follows: \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) = 300 + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc61/100 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc34(0) = 300 + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc520 =\u21d2 100 = 300 + \ud835\udc35 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc35 = \u2212200. Consequently, the amount of salt in kilograms at time \ud835\udc61 minutes is given by \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) = 300 \u2212200\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc61/100.

At time \ud835\udc61 = 0, the tank contains (0 .1 kg/L) (1000 L) = 100 kg of salt, hence \ud835\udc34(0) = 100. Using this initial condition, we may solve for \ud835\udc35 as follows: \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) = 300 + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc61/100 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc34(0) = 300 + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc520 =\u21d2 100 = 300 + \ud835\udc35 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc35 = \u2212200. Consequently, the amount of salt in kilograms at time \ud835\udc61 minutes is given by \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) = 300 \u2212200\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc61/100. Section 2.2 Separable Differential Equations 159 (b) Approximately how much salt would we expect the tank to contain after a long period of time (i.e., as \ud835\udc61 approaches infinity)? Solution: We can use the function \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) from part (a) to determine the expected amount of salt in the tank after a long period of time. In particular, we expect this amount to be lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61) = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e (\ufe01 300 \u2212200\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc61/100 )\ufe01 = 300 \u2212200(0) = 300 kg. This makes sense: as \ud835\udc61 approaches infinity, the concentration in the tank will approach that of the incoming salt solution, which is 0 .3 kg/L. Since the tank contains 1000 L of solution at any given time, we expect the amount of salt in the tank after a long period of time to be approximately (0.3 kg/L) (1000\ud835\udc3f) = 300 kg.

Example 2.3.2 (a) \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 is a linear DE of order 1.

Example 2.3.3 (a) \ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc662 = 1 is a non-linear DE due to the term \ud835\udc662.

In this section we will learn methods for solving linear DEs of order 1. That is, we will solve DEs of the form \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc340(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc65), where \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) \u0338\u22610. By dividing both sides by \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65), the DE can be rewritten as \ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65).

REMARK The astute reader may note that while \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) \u0338\u22610 (i.e. \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) is not 0 everywhere), it may very well be the case that \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) = 0 at some values of \ud835\udc65. This begs the question: When writing a first-order linear DE \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc340(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc65) in standard form, is it really okay to divide by \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) if that function is sometimes 0? 162 Chapter 2 Differential Equations Yes, it is okay to divide by a function \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) that is equal to 0 for some \ud835\udc65. When this is the case, dividing by \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) may impose domain restrictions on our solutions, but we can still obtain solutions defined where \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) is non-zero. For instance, we can rewrite the DE ( \ud835\udc652 \u22121)\ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 = 2 in standard form by dividing both sides by of the equation by \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 \u22121. Since \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) = 0 when \ud835\udc65 = \u00b11, any solutions we find after dividing through by \ud835\udc341(\ud835\udc65) may only be valid for \ud835\udc65 \u0338= \u00b11.

At any rate, we will not worry too much about potential issues at individual points in our solutions\u2019 domains. The following preliminary example will help to motivate the general strategy for solving first order linear DEs. Example 2.3.5 Consider the first-order linear DE \ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 = 1. The trick in this example is to multiply by \ud835\udc653 on both sides of the equation to obtain \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653. Notice that the left-hand side is now \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc66, which is exactly the derivative of \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66 by the product rule. Thus, the DE can be written as (\ufe00 \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66 )\ufe00\u2032 = \ud835\udc653. Integrating both sides with respect to \ud835\udc65, we obtain \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe00 \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66 )\ufe00\u2032 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc653 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 hence \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc654 4 + \ud835\udc36. Dividing by \ud835\udc653, we arrive at the general solution \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 4 + \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc653 , \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. REMARK In some of our earlier examples, we saw that constants in the general solution to a DE could be \u201cbundled\u201d together as a new constant to simplify the description of the solutions. For instance, in Example 2.2.5, we obtained the family of solutions \ud835\udc66 = \u00b1 \u221a\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 + 2(\ud835\udc362 \u2212\ud835\udc361). For simplicity, we chose to represent the arbitrary constant 2( \ud835\udc362 \u2212\ud835\udc361) using a new letter, \ud835\udc36, giving the general solution \ud835\udc66 = \u00b1 \u221a\ufe00 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc36, \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. Section 2.3 Linear First-Order Differential Equations 163 In Example 2.3.5, it may therefore be tempting to let a new letter, say \ud835\udc37, denote the term \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc653 and report the general solution as \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 4 + \ud835\udc37. Do not do this! The difference here is that \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc653 represents a family of functions, not constants. This family includes 1 \ud835\udc653 , \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc653 , \u22121 2\ud835\udc653 , and all other functions of this form. If we were to replace \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc653 with \ud835\udc37 and report \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 4 + \ud835\udc37 as the general solution, there would be no indication about which specific functions the term \ud835\udc37 is meant to represent. The moral: it is okay to introduce a new letter to represent a family of arbitrary constants; but it is not okay to introduce a letter to represent a family of functions, since this hides important information about the specific functions in the general solution. Our goal is to generalize the strategy from Example 2.3.5 to solve any first-order linear DE. Specifically, given a DE of the form",

Let\u2019s see if we can figure out which function \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) will make equation ( **) valid. By the product rule, (\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66)\u2032= \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66\u2032+\ud835\udf07\u2032(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66; hence, for (**) to be true, it must be the case that \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udf07\u2032(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc66. . In particular, by comparing the underlined factors in the equation above, we require that \ud835\udf07\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65), which is itself a separable DE that we can solve to obtain \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)! Indeed, writing \ud835\udf07\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 , we can calculate \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) as follows: \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) = \u21d2 \u222b\ufe01 1 \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf07 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 ln |\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)|= \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52 \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. 164 Chapter 2 Differential Equations Definition 2.3.6 Integrating Factor Given a DE of the form \ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65), the function \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52 \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 is called an integrating factor for the DE. Recall that in Example 2.3.5, we solved the differential equation \ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 = 1, which has the form \ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) where \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) = 3 \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) = 1. Our approach was to multiply both sides of the DE by \ud835\udc653 \u2013 which may have seemed like a random trick at the time \u2013 but now we are in a position to understand how that factor of \ud835\udc653 was determined. Indeed, we have just discovered that the DE \ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65) can be readily solved upon multiplying both sides by the integrating factor \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52 \u222b\ufe00 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

REMARK In the calculation of \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc653 above, you may have noticed that we were a bit sloppy with the integration. In particular, we wrote ln( \ud835\udc65) instead of ln |\ud835\udc65|and omitted the arbitrary constant, \ud835\udc36. It turns out that it is okay to omit these components when calculating \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65). The reason is that since \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) will be multiplied on both sides of the DE, the absolute value and the \ud835\udc36 will simply \u201ccancel out\u201d on the left- and right-hand sides of the equation. Thus, there is nothing gained by including these components in the first place. Let\u2019s experiment with this in our example! (i) Suppose we had included \u201c+ \ud835\udc36\u201d when calculating \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65): \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52 \u222b\ufe00 3 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc523 ln(\ud835\udc65)+\ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52ln(\ud835\udc653) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc653. When \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) is multiplied on both sides of the DE \ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 = 1, we obtain \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66\u2032+ \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc363\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc653, from which we see that \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36 can be cancelled on both sides, leading to the equation \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653. This is exactly the equation we would have obtained had we simply omitted \ud835\udc36 in our calculation of \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)! Section 2.3 Linear First-Order Differential Equations 165 (ii) Suppose we had included an absolute value when calculating \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65): \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52 \u222b\ufe00 3 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc523 ln|\ud835\udc65|= \ud835\udc52ln(|\ud835\udc65|3) = |\ud835\udc65|3.

We now consider two cases. If \ud835\udc65 is positive, hence |\ud835\udc65|= \ud835\udc65, our equation becomes \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653. If instead \ud835\udc65 is negative, hence |\ud835\udc65|= \u2212\ud835\udc65, our equation becomes (\u2212\ud835\udc65)3\ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3(\u2212\ud835\udc65)3 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 = (\u2212\ud835\udc65)3 or, upon multiplying both sides of the equation by \u22121 and simplifying, \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653. In either case we end up with \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc66\u2032+ 3\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653, which is exactly what we would have obtained had we simply omitted the absolute value in our calculation of \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)!

Solution: Following the steps above, we first divide by\ud835\udc65 to put the DE into standard form: \ud835\udc66\u2032\u22121 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 cos \ud835\udc65.

As expected, the left-hand side can be recognized the derivative of the product \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66 = 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66, leading to the equation (\ufe021 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 )\ufe02\u2032 = cos(\ud835\udc65).

Finally, we arrive at the general solution by multiplying both sides by \ud835\udc65: \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65 sin \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc36 \u2208R.

Solution: The DE is already in standard form with \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) = 2 \ud835\udc65. We will therefore begin by multiplying both sides by the integrating factor \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52 \u222b\ufe00 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65= \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 .

Recognizing the left-hand side as the derivative of \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc66, we obtain (\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc66 )\ufe01\u2032 = 4\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 . We integrate both sides, using the substitution \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65to evaluate the integral on the right-hand side: \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc66 = \u222b\ufe01 4\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe01 2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc62 + \ud835\udc36 = 2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc36. Dividing by \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 , we find the general solution to be \ud835\udc66 = 2 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 , \ud835\udc36 \u2208R. We may determine the constant \ud835\udc36 using the initial condition \ud835\udc66(0) = 7: \ud835\udc66 = 2 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 =\u21d2 7 = 2 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc520 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc36 = 5. Thus, \ud835\udc66 = 2 + 5\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 is the particular solution to the IVP.

In Problem 2.2.4b, we set up the following initial value problem for a function \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61), representing the amount of chlorine in a tank at time \ud835\udc61: \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = 1 5 \u2212 2\ud835\udc34 20 \u2212\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34 (0) = 0. The differential equation in this initial value problem is not separable (and hence we could not solve it in the previous section); however, it is linear! Solve this initial value problem for \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc61). 2.3.6.

In this section we will take a detailed look at a few more applications of the DEs we have studied. Specifically, we will explore models for heating and cooling, exponential growth and decay, and logistic population growth. 2.4.1 Newton\u2019s Law of Heating/Cooling Newton\u2019s Law of Heating/Cooling states that the temperature of an object changes at a rate that is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of its surroundings. We may rephrase Newton\u2019s law as a differential equation. If \ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) denotes the temper- ature of the object at time \ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 denotes the temperature of its surroundings (which is assumed to be constant), then, for some proportionality constant \ud835\udc58 >0, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u2212\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc47 \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60). REMARKS (i) The constant of proportionality, \ud835\udc58, is a measure of the object\u2019s ability to exchange heat energy and depends on the material properties of the object. (ii) To see why the coefficient of \ud835\udc47 \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 is negative, observe that if \ud835\udc47 \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 > 0, then the temperature of the object is greater than that of its surroundings, meaning that \ud835\udc47 should decrease over time (i.e., \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 < 0). Likewise, if \ud835\udc47 \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 < 0, then the temperature of the object is lower than that of its surroundings and hence the temperature will increase over time (i.e., \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 > 0). The negative coefficient ensures that the sign of the derivative is consistent with these expectations. We will now solve the DE above to determine what functions \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) obey Newton\u2019s Law of Heating/Cooling. This DE is both separable and linear. We will solve it here as a separable DE. You are encouraged to try solving it as a linear DE for practice. First note that one solution occurs when \ud835\udc47 \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 \u22610 or, equivalently, when \ud835\udc47 \u2261\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60. In this case, the temperature of the object is exactly equal to the temperature of its surroundings and does not change over time (i.e., \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u22610).

Thus, the general solution is given by \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 for some constant \ud835\udc34. We summarize our findings in the following theorem. Theorem 2.4.1 (The Newton\u2019s Law of Heating/Cooling DE and its Solution) If \ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) denotes the temperature of an object as a function of time and\ud835\udc47 varies according to Newton\u2019s Law of Cooling, then \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u2212\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc47 \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60), where \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 is the temperature of the object\u2019s surroundings. The solutions to this DE are \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61, where \ud835\udc34 is a constant. REMARK From the solutions to the DE for Newton\u2019s Law of Cooling, we can make an interesting observation about the long term behaviour of the temperature of our object. Indeed, if the object\u2019s temperature is given by \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61, then as \ud835\udc61 tends to infinity, we have lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) = lim \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e (\ufe01 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 )\ufe01 = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc34 \u00b70 = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60. That is, the temperature of the object approaches that of its surroundings, just as we would expect in the physical world. Example 2.4.2 A bowl of curry is heated to 45 \u2218C and placed into a 25 \u2218C room to cool. After \ud835\udc61 = 1 hour, the curry has cooled to 35 \u2218C. Determine the temperature of the curry at \ud835\udc61 = 2 hours. Solution: Section 2.4 Applications of Differential Equations 171 Let \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) denote the temperature of the curry at time \ud835\udc61 hours. Assuming that the tempera- ture varies according to Newton\u2019s Law of Cooling, we must solve the initial value problem \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u2212\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc47 \u221225), \ud835\udc47 (0) = 45, \ud835\udc47 (1) = 35. From Theorem 2.4.1, the solutions to the DE will have the form \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) = 25 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61. In order to calculate \ud835\udc47(2) \u2013 the temperature after \ud835\udc61 = 2 hours \u2013 we must first determine the constants \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc58 using the initial conditions. Using \ud835\udc47(0) = 45, we have 45 = 25 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58(0) = 25 + \ud835\udc34, hence \ud835\udc34",

From Theorem 2.4.1, the solutions to the DE will have the form \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) = 25 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61. In order to calculate \ud835\udc47(2) \u2013 the temperature after \ud835\udc61 = 2 hours \u2013 we must first determine the constants \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc58 using the initial conditions. Using \ud835\udc47(0) = 45, we have 45 = 25 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58(0) = 25 + \ud835\udc34, hence \ud835\udc34 = 20. Using \ud835\udc47(1) = 35, we find that 35 = 25+20\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58(1), and hence \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58 = 35\u221225 20 = 1 2 . It follows that \ud835\udc58 = \u2212ln (\ufe001 2 )\ufe00 . Therefore, the temperature of the curry at time \ud835\udc61 is \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) = 25 + 20\ud835\udc52ln(1 2 )\ud835\udc61, or, equivalently, \ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc61) = 25 + 20 (\ufe021 2 )\ufe02\ud835\udc61 . Thus, at \ud835\udc61 = 2 hours, the temperature of the curry will be \ud835\udc47(2) = 25 + 20 (\ufe021 2 )\ufe022 = 25 + 20 (\ufe021 4 )\ufe02 = 30\u2218C. 2.4.2 Exponential Growth and Decay Exponential growth/decay occurs when a population changes at a rate that is proportional to its size. Thus, if \ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) denotes the size of a population at time \ud835\udc61, then exponential growth/decay occurs when \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43 for some constant \ud835\udc58. Note that if \ud835\udc58 >0, then \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 > 0, meaning that \ud835\udc43 is increasing (i.e., \ud835\udc43 exhibits growth). If instead \ud835\udc58 <0, then \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 < 0, meaning that \ud835\udc43 is decreasing (i.e., \ud835\udc43 exhibits decay). The exponential growth DE is both separable and linear and hence can be solved using the methods from sections 2.2 or 2.3. The general solution is \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 for some constant \ud835\udc34. In fact, given an initial population \ud835\udc43(0), we have \ud835\udc43(0) = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58(0) = \ud835\udc34. 172 Chapter 2 Differential Equations Theorem 2.4.3 (The Exponential Growth/Decay DE and its Solutions) The solutions to the exponential growth DE \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43 are given by \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61, where \ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udc43(0). Example 2.4.4 A population of hedgehogs grows exponentially starting with 2 hedgehogs. After 1 year, there are 20 hedgehogs. How many hedgehogs will there be after 100 years? Solution: Here, \ud835\udc43(0) = 2. The population \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) is therefore given by \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = 2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61. We may solve for \ud835\udc58 using the fact that \ud835\udc43(1) = 20. Indeed, \ud835\udc43(1) = 20 = \u21d2 20 = 2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58(1) =\u21d2 10 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc58 = ln(10). Hence, we have \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = 2\ud835\udc52ln(10)\ud835\udc61 = 2 \u00b710\ud835\udc61. Thus, after 100 years, we expect \ud835\udc43(100) = 2 \u00b710100 hedgehogs. In the above example, is it realistic to expect a population of 2 \u00b710100 hedgehogs after 100 years? For comparison, the number of atoms in the known universe is estimated to be around 1080, and our model is predicting even more hedgehogs than that! Of course, this would be impossible in",

            "text": "We may solve for \ud835\udc58 using the fact that \ud835\udc43(1) = 20. Indeed, \ud835\udc43(1) = 20 = \u21d2 20 = 2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58(1) =\u21d2 10 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc58 = ln(10). Hence, we have \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = 2\ud835\udc52ln(10)\ud835\udc61 = 2 \u00b710\ud835\udc61. Thus, after 100 years, we expect \ud835\udc43(100) = 2 \u00b710100 hedgehogs. In the above example, is it realistic to expect a population of 2 \u00b710100 hedgehogs after 100 years? For comparison, the number of atoms in the known universe is estimated to be around 1080, and our model is predicting even more hedgehogs than that! Of course, this would be impossible in a real-world scenario. The above example highlights one of the limitations of the exponential growth model: it predicts unbounded growth! In reality, the availability of food, water, and space, all impose limits on the size a population can reach. The maximum number of organisms that can exist in a population is known as the pop- ulation\u2019s carrying capacity. We will explore a more sophisticated population model that accounts for carrying capacity in the next section. Before moving on, let\u2019s explore an application that is modelled realistically by the expo- nential DE: radioactive decay! Example 2.4.5 Carbon-14 is a radioactive compound that exists in all living organisms. It decays expo- nentially with a half life of around 5730 years, meaning that after this amount of time, half of the atoms in a carbon-14 sample will have decayed. An organism\u2019s carbon-14 supply is constantly renewed while the organism is living, but no new carbon-14 is created after its death. Scientists can therefore use the amount of carbon- Section 2.4 Applications of Differential Equations 173 14 present in a deceased organism to estimate the amount time since its death. This process is known as carbon dating. Given that an animal bone contains 20% of a normal supply of carbon-14, approximately how old is the bone? Solution: Let \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) denote the percentage of carbon-14 remaining in the bone after \ud835\udc61 years. At \ud835\udc61 = 0, the bone contains \ud835\udc43(0) = 100 percent of its carbon-14 content; and since \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) exhibits exponential decay, it follows that \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = 100\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 for some constant \ud835\udc58. Since carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years, \ud835\udc43(5730) = 50 percent. We may use this condition to solve for \ud835\udc58: \ud835\udc43(5730) = 50 = \u21d2 50 = 100\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58(5730) =\u21d2 \ud835\udc525730\ud835\udc58 = 50 100 = 1 2 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc58 = 1 5730 ln (\ufe021 2 )\ufe02 Therefore, we find that \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = 100\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc61 5730 ln(1/2) = 100 (\ufe01 \ud835\udc52ln(1/2) )\ufe01\ud835\udc61/5730 = 100 (\ufe021 2 )\ufe02\ud835\udc61/5730 . We now wish to determine the value of \ud835\udc61 such that \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = 20 percent. We have \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = 20 = \u21d2 100 (\ufe021 2 )\ufe02\ud835\udc61/5730 = 20 =\u21d2 (\ufe021 2 )\ufe02\ud835\udc61/5730 = 1 5 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc61 5730 = log1 2 (\ufe021 5 )\ufe02 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc61 = 5730 log1 2 (\ufe021 5 )\ufe02 \u224813304.65.

The logistic model for population growth purports that \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43 (\ufe02 1 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 )\ufe02 , 174 Chapter 2 Differential Equations where \ud835\udc40 is the carrying capacity of the population and \ud835\udc58 is a constant. REMARK There are various interesting features of the logistic model that can be observed from this differential equation. Each of these features is consistent with what one would actually observe in populations in nature, thus supporting the accuracy of the logistic model. (i) First consider the case in which the that the population, \ud835\udc43, is well below the carrying capacity, \ud835\udc40. In this case, \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 will be approximately 0, hence \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43 (\ufe02 1 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 )\ufe02 \u2248\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43. Thus, the logistic model predicts exponential growth when the size of the population is well below capacity. (ii) Now consider the case in which the population is near capacity, so \ud835\udc43 is approximately equal to \ud835\udc40. Since \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 is then approximately 1, we have \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43 (\ufe02 1 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 )\ufe02 \u22480. That is, the logistic model predicts little to no growth when the population is close to capacity. (iii) In the case that the population \ud835\udc43 does exceed \ud835\udc40 (due to, for example, additional organisms being forced into a colony at capacity), then \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 will be greater than 1, hence \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43 (\ufe02 1 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 )\ufe02 \u23df \u23de <0 < 0. Thus, the logistic model predicts that the population will decline. We will now solve the logistic differential equation as a separable DE. First note that there exist two equilibrium (i.e., constant) solutions to this DE obtained by setting \ud835\udc43 (\ufe00 1 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 )\ufe00 \u22610. One such solution occurs when \ud835\udc43 \u22610, in which case there exist no organisms at all and hence no change in population over time. Another such solution occurs when 1 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 \u22610 or, equivalently, when \ud835\udc43 \u2261\ud835\udc40. In this case, the population is exactly at capacity and also has no tendency to change. Let us now focus on the more interesting case in which \ud835\udc43 is not constant. Assuming that \ud835\udc43 \u0338\u22610 and \ud835\udc43 \u0338\u2261\ud835\udc40, we may rewrite the DE as \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc43 (\ufe00 1 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 )\ufe00 = \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61, or, equivalently, \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40 \u2212\ud835\udc43) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61.

Section 2.4 Applications of Differential Equations 175 We then integrate both sides of the equation, using the partial fraction decomposition \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc43\u2212\ud835\udc40) = 1 \ud835\udc43 + 1 \ud835\udc40\u2212\ud835\udc43 to simplify the integral on the left-hand side. We have \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40 \u2212\ud835\udc43) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61, hence \u222b\ufe01 (\ufe02 1 \ud835\udc43 + 1 \ud835\udc40 \u2212\ud835\udc43 )\ufe02 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 = \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61, and therefore ln |\ud835\udc43|\u2212ln |\ud835\udc40 \u2212\ud835\udc43|= \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc36. To solve for \ud835\udc43, we begin by combining the terms on the left-hand side: ln \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc36. The equation can then be written as \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 \u2212\ud835\udc43 = \u00b1\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc36 = \u00b1\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61, or, by reciprocating both sides, \ud835\udc40 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc43 = \u00b1\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61, where \ud835\udc34 = \u00b1\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc36. Separating the fraction on the left-hand side, we find that \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc43 \u22121 = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61, and hence, finally, \ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc40 1 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 . In fact, we can say a bit more. Given an initial population \ud835\udc43(0), we have \ud835\udc43(0) = \ud835\udc40 1 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc520 = \ud835\udc40 1 + \ud835\udc34. This means that \ud835\udc43(0) + \ud835\udc43(0)\ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udc40, and therefore we may solve for \ud835\udc34 as \ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udc40 \u2212\ud835\udc43(0) \ud835\udc43(0) . Our findings above are summarized in the following theorem. Theorem 2.4.6 (The Logistic DE and its Solutions) Let \ud835\udc40 denote the carrying capacity of a population. The solutions to the logistic DE \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc43 (\ufe02 1 \u2212\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc40 )\ufe02 are given by \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc40 1 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 , where \ud835\udc34 is a constant. Furthermore, if \ud835\udc43(0) is the initial population, then \ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udc40\u2212\ud835\udc43(0) \ud835\udc43(0) . 176 Chapter 2 Differential Equations Below is a typical solution curve to the logistic DE. From the graph, we can observe some of the important features mentioned in the remark at the outset of the section: rapid growth when the population is well below the carrying capacity and tapered growth near the carrying capacity. \ud835\udc43(0) \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc43 Example 2.4.7 Scientists placed 100 geese in an enclosed nature preserve.

In (a) and (b), set up but do not evaluate a differential equation that describes each situation. Include all initial conditions. Do not solve for the proportionality constants that may appear in the DE. (a) A frozen pizza is placed in a 260 \u2218\ud835\udc36 pizza oven. The temperature of the pizza, \ud835\udc47, is \u221210\u2218\ud835\udc36 when the pizza enters the oven, and after \ud835\udc61 = 3 minutes, the temperature is 15\u2218\ud835\udc36. Assume the temperature of the pizza varies according to Newton\u2019s Law of Heating/Cooling. (b) The population of geese on the UW campus grows logistically with a carrying capacity of \ud835\udc40 = 400 geese. The population, \ud835\udc43, starts with only 12 geese, but after \ud835\udc61 = 4 years, it has grown to 170 geese. 2.4.2. A hot cup of tea is placed in a room of temperature 20 \u2218C. The temperature of the tea is initially measured to be 95 \u2218C and after \ud835\udc61 = 2 minutes, its temperature has dropped to 80\u2218C. Assuming that the temperature of the tea obeys Newton\u2019s Law of Cooling, determine the temperature of the tea as a function of time.

We all have had lots of experiences with such infinite sums already. One of your earliest encounters with the notion of infinity was when you learned that 1 3 = 0.333 . . .= 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = 3 10 + 3 100 + 3 1000 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . This infinite sum is a special case of the sum of a geometric series (see Example 3.1.12(i) below). It is also clear that there are many infinite sums that cannot be equal to any real number, for example, 1 + 2 + 3 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 , which is bigger than any fixed real number and should be equal to \u221e(see Example 3.1.6 below).",

By the end of this chapter, you will have learned many different methods to determine whether an infinite sum of real numbers is equal to a finite real number or not. What you learn in this chapter will serve as a foundation for your studies in the next chapter wherein you will learn about infinite sums of functions. 3.1 Introduction to Series Definition 3.1.1 Infinite Series Let {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 be a sequence of real numbers. An infinite series is a symbolic expression of the form \ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 + \ud835\udc4e3 + \ud835\udc4e4 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Example 3.1.2 (i) 1 + 1 4 + 1 9 + 1 16 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 We will analyze this infinite series later in Example 3.3.6(i). 179 180 Chapter 3 Numerical Series (ii) 1 2 + 2 3 + 3 4 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b + 1 We will analyze this infinite series later in Example 3.2.7(i). (iii) 1 \u22121 + 1\u22121 + 1\u2212\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b+1 We will analyze this infinite series later in Example 3.1.7 and again in Example 3.2.7(ii). The above examples are formal expressions at the moment since we don\u2019t know exactly what they mean numerically. Our immediate task is to define what we mean by such infinite sums. First we will convert an infinite series to be the limit of a certain sequence. Definition 3.1.3 Partial Sum Given an infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b, we define its sequence of partial sums, {\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a}\u221e \ud835\udc5a=1, as \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a is called the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of the infinite series. Note that \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a is the sum of initial terms in the sequence {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 up to (and including) \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a. Example 3.1.4 For \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 , we can compute that \ud835\udc461 = 1, \ud835\udc462 = 1 + 1 4 = 5 4, \ud835\udc463 = 1 + 1 4 + 1 9 = 49 36, etc. Now we are ready to define what it means for an infinite series to be equal to a finite real number. Definition 3.1.5 Convergence and Divergence We say that an infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges to \ud835\udc46 \u2208R if lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e (\ufe03 \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b )\ufe03 = \ud835\udc46.

Here, \ud835\udc46 is called the sum of the infinite series and we write \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc46. If {\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a}\u221e \ud835\udc5a=1 diverges, then we say that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges. Furthermore, if lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \u00b1\u221e, then we say that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges to \u00b1\u221e. Section 3.1 Introduction to Series 181 Example 3.1.6 \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b = 1 + 2 + 3 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 has partial sums equal to \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc5a + 1) 2 , as per the formula first provided in Section 1.1.3. Since lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc5a + 1) 2 = \u221e, we conclude that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b diverges to \u221e. Example 3.1.7 \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b+1 has partial sums \ud835\udc461 = 1, \ud835\udc462 = 0, \ud835\udc463 = 1, \ud835\udc464 = 0, etc. We see that these terms oscillate, so lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a does not exist, and \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b+1 diverges. Example 3.1.8 (Harmonic Series) Let\u2019s examine a famous infinite series called the \u201charmonic series\u201d, which is \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b. We claim that this series diverges. To prove our claim, we will argue by contradiction. Suppose that it converged to a real number \ud835\udc46. Then we would have \ud835\udc46 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b = (\ufe02 1 + 1 2 )\ufe02 + (\ufe021 3 + 1 4 )\ufe02 + (\ufe021 5 + 1 6 )\ufe02 + (\ufe021 7 + 1 8 )\ufe02 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 > (\ufe021 2 + 1 2 )\ufe02 + (\ufe021 4 + 1 4 )\ufe02 + (\ufe021 6 + 1 6 )\ufe02 + (\ufe021 8 + 1 8 )\ufe02 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = \ud835\udc46. Thus we could deduce that \ud835\udc46 > \ud835\udc46, which is impossible. Hence our harmonic series diverges. The divergence of harmonic series can also be derived from Corollary 3.3.5 which will be proved later. REMARK The name \u201charmonic\u201d refers to fundamental frequency in musical theory. The mathematical study of musical harmonics goes as far back as Pythagoras (circa 570\u2013490 BC).

Using mathematical induction, we can show that \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = 1 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5a + 1. Thus we have lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e (\ufe02 1 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5a + 1 )\ufe02 = 1 \u22120 = 1. It follows that our series converges to 1. Such an infinite series whose partial sums contain consecutive cancellations is called a \u201ctelescoping series\u201d. It turns out that computing sums of infinite series is a very difficult task in general. Unlike the above telescoping series, we usually cannot find explicit formulas for the partial sums. However, there is another family of series for which we can compute the partial sums explicitly. Definition 3.1.10 Geometric Series Let \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc65\u2208R such that \ud835\udc4e \u0338= 0. A geometric series is a series of the form \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc653 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . \ud835\udc4e is called the first term of the geometric series, and \ud835\udc65 is called the ratio of the geometric series. We have chosen the convention that for a geometric series, the index \ud835\udc5b starts at \ud835\udc5b = 0 instead of the usual \ud835\udc5b = 1. We define the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of the geometric series to be \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc652 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a. Note that \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a for a geometric series contains \ud835\udc5a + 1 terms instead of the usual \ud835\udc5a terms. We have chosen the convention that the index \ud835\udc5a in \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a indicates that the sum stops at the \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5a term (and does not indicate that the number of terms in \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a is \ud835\udc5a). REMARK We have chosen the above convention so that a geometric series is an example of a so-called \u201cpower series\u201d which will be studied in the next chapter. One of the reasons why we use the adjective \u201cgeometric\u201d is the observation that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b equals the \ud835\udc5b-dimensional volume of an \ud835\udc5b-dimensional cube that has side length \ud835\udc65. ( \ud835\udc652 is the 2- dimensional area of a square with side length \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc653 is the 3-dimensional volume of a cube with side length \ud835\udc65, etc.) We can compute the partial sums of a geometric series as follows. First we notice that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1 \u22121 = (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc65 + 1).

Section 3.1 Introduction to Series 183 If \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 1, then we can divide by \ud835\udc65 \u22121 and obtain \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc65 + 1 = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1 \u22121 \ud835\udc65 \u22121 . Rearranging the left side and multiplying the top and the bottom of the quotient in the right side by \u22121, we get 1 + \ud835\udc65 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65 , as long as \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 1.

Theorem 3.1.11 (Geometric Series Test) Let \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b be a geometric series, where \ud835\udc4e \u0338= 0. (i) If |\ud835\udc65|< 1, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b converges and \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4e 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65. (ii) If |\ud835\udc65|\u2265 1, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b diverges. Proof: Case 1. Suppose that \ud835\udc65 = 1. Then our geometric series becomes \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4e + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . Thus \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = (\ud835\udc5a + 1)\ud835\udc4e, and so lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e (\ud835\udc5a + 1)\ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc4e \u00b7 lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e (\ud835\udc5a + 1) = {\ufe03 \u221e if \ud835\udc4e >0, \u2212\u221e if \ud835\udc4e <0. Hence the series diverges in this case. Case 2. Suppose that \ud835\udc65 = \u22121. Then our geometric series becomes \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e(\u22121)\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc4e + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . 184 Chapter 3 Numerical Series Thus we have \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = {\ufe03 \ud835\udc4e if \ud835\udc5a is even, 0 if \ud835\udc5a is odd. Since \ud835\udc4e \u0338= 0, the limit lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a does not exist. Hence the series diverges in this case too. Combining Cases 1 and 2, we can now conclude that our geometric series diverges when |\ud835\udc65|= 1. Case 3. Suppose that \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 1 and \ud835\udc65 \u0338= \u22121. Then we had computed that \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc4e \u00b71 \u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a+1 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65 . It follows that lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e \u00b71 \u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a+1 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e \u00b7 1 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65(1 \u2212 lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a+1). We note that lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a+1 = \u23a7 \u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23a9 0 if |\ud835\udc65|< 1, \u221e if \ud835\udc65 >1, does not exist if \ud835\udc65 <\u22121. If |\ud835\udc65|< 1, then we have lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc4e \u00b7 1 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65(1",

Zeno claimed that if the tortoise is given a head start, then no matter how fast Achilles runs, he will never catch the tortoise. He reasoned as follows: In order to catch the tortoise, Achilles must first make up the length of the head start, but then the tortoise will have advanced further. While Achilles makes up this distance, the tortoise advances still further, and so on. It follows that Achilles is always making up distance covered by the tortoise, and therefore can never catch the tortoise. If the tortoise is given a head start of length \ud835\udc3f and Achilles runs \ud835\udc50 >1 times as fast as the tortoise, use the limit of a geometric series to show that Achilles does, in fact, catch the tortoise and that the total distance he covers in doing so is \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc50 \u22121)\u22121. 3.1.8.

Hence the tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc5a+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b can be viewed as the error made by the estimate \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a. We note that a tail is itself an infinite series whose first term is \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+1. It turns out that the convergence of an infinite series depends only on the convergence of its tails. In other words, changing finitely many terms at the beginning of the series will not affect its convergence. Theorem 3.2.3 (Tail Convergence Theorem) Let {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 be a sequence and let \ud835\udc57 denote a positive integer. (i) If \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges, then its tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b also converges for each \ud835\udc57 \u22651. (ii) If the tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges for some \ud835\udc57, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b also converges. Proof: Let \ud835\udc5a be any positive integer satisfying \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc57. Let \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Let \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of the tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. (Note that the number of terms in \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a is \ud835\udc5a \u2212(\ud835\udc57 \u22121) = \ud835\udc5a \u2212\ud835\udc57 + 1.) We have the identity \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = (\ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57\u22121) + \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a, where (\ud835\udc4e1 +\ud835\udc4e2 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57\u22121) is a finite sum of real numbers and hence is a finite real number. (i) Suppose that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges, i.e., \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc46 for some \ud835\udc46 \u2208R. Then for each \ud835\udc57 \u22651, we have \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e (\ufe00 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u2212(\ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57\u22121) )\ufe00 = \ud835\udc46 \u2212(\ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57\u22121). Hence \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges for each \ud835\udc57 \u22651.

Then we have \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57\u22121) + \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a )\ufe00 = (\ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57\u22121) + \ud835\udc47. Section 3.2 Arithmetic Properties of Series and the Divergence Test 191 Hence \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges. Corollary 3.2.4 (Tail Divergence Theorem) Let \ud835\udc57 denote a positive integer. (i) If a tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges for some \ud835\udc57, then the original series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges too. (ii) If \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges, then its tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges for each \ud835\udc57 \u22651.

Proof: These statements are just contrapositives of the corresponding parts of the Tail Convergence Theorem. As we mentioned in the previous section, it is generally quite difficult to compute the sum of a convergent infinite series explicitly. For example, it is known that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 converges to \ud835\udf0b2 6 , but the computation is highly non-trivial and requires more advanced calculus than what is covered in this course. However, it is often easier to determine whether a series converges (or diverges) without worrying about what the sum will be. For the rest of this section, we will content ourselves with obtaining a method to quickly determine whether an infinite series diverges. We start with a necessary condition for an infinite series to converge. Theorem 3.2.5 (Necessary Condition for Convergence) If \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges, then lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = 0. Proof: Let \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Suppose that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges, i.e., \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc46 for some \ud835\udc46 \u2208 R. We note that \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\u22121 = (\ud835\udc4e1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\u22121 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a) \u2212(\ud835\udc4e1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\u22121) = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a for all \ud835\udc5a \u22652. Hence we conclude that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\u22121) = (\ufe01 lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a )\ufe01 \u2212 (\ufe01 lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\u22121 )\ufe01 = \ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc46 = 0. 192 Chapter 3 Numerical Series REMARK Note that we have \ud835\udc5a \u2192 \u221eif and only if \ud835\udc5a \u22121 \u2192 \u221e. Hence we can conclude that lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\u22121 = lim \ud835\udc5a\u22121\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\u22121 = \ud835\udc46 in the previous proof. The contrapositive statement of the previous theorem is quite useful and has a name. Corollary 3.2.6 (Divergence Test) If lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u0338= 0, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges. Example 3.2.7 (i) Since lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b + 1 = 1 \u0338= 0, the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b + 1 diverges by the Divergence Test. (ii) Since lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b+1 does not exist (and hence this limit is not equal to 0), the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b+1 diverges by the Divergence Test. When you encounter a numerically complicated series, you may want to use the Divergence Test first to see if the series actually diverges. Example 3.2.8 Since lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e arctan(\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udf0b 2 \u0338= 0, the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 arctan(\ud835\udc5b) diverges by the Divergence Test.

REMARK The converse of the Divergence Test is false. In other words, it is possible for an infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b to diverge yet lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = 0. For an example, consider the harmonic series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b. We saw in the previous section that this series diverges. On the other hand, we have lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b = 0. Section 3.2 Arithmetic Properties of Series and the Divergence Test 193 Finally, we end this section with a warning! The Divergence Test can only tell us if a series diverges and never that a series converges. Consider the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 . We can compute that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b2 = 0. Hence the Divergence Test does not apply and we cannot conclude whether this series converges or diverges using the Divergence Test. In the next section, we will see that this series converges using the so-called \u201cIntegral Test\u201d. Section 3.2 Problems 3.2.1.

Section 3.3 Integral Test 195 3.3 Integral Test Definition 3.3.1 Positive Series An infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b is said to be positive (or nonnegative) if \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u22650 for all \ud835\udc5b \u22651. It is said to be strictly positive if \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b > 0 for all \ud835\udc5b \u22651. It is said to be eventually positive (or eventually nonnegative ) if there is a positive integer \ud835\udc57 such that \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u22650 for all \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc57. Finally, it is said to be eventually strictly positive if there is a positive integer \ud835\udc57 such that \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b > 0 for all \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc57. Clearly, a positive infinite series is an eventually positive infinite series (with \ud835\udc57 = 1). Lemma 3.3.2 Let \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b be an eventually positive series. Let \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b denote its \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum. Then there are only two possibilities. (i) If the sequence of partial sums {\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a}\u221e \ud835\udc5a=1 is bounded from above, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges. (ii) If the sequence of partial sums {\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a}\u221e \ud835\udc5a=1 is not bounded from above, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges to \u221e. Proof: Suppose that \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u22650 for all \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc57. Consider the tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b and its partial sums \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b, where \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc57. For any positive integer \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc57, we have \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a+1 \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = \u239b \u239d \ud835\udc5a+1\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u239e \u23a0 \u2212 \u239b \u239d \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u239e \u23a0 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+1 \u22650.

The goal of this section is to obtain a test that we can apply to an eventually positive series to determine whether that series converges or not.

A function \ud835\udc53 is said to be decreasing (or non-increasing) on an interval \ud835\udc3c if \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc651) \u2265\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc652) for any pair \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652 \u2208\ud835\udc3c satisfying \ud835\udc651 < \ud835\udc652.

Section 3.3 Integral Test 197 \u2022 {\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a}\u221e \ud835\udc5a=1 is not bounded from above. In this case lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \u221e, and hence \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) diverges to \u221e. 1 2 3 4 \ud835\udc431 \ud835\udc432 \ud835\udc433 \ud835\udc434 \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc66 Figure 3.3.1: Estimating the area under\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) using partial sums Figure 3.3.1 shows a typical example of a function that satisfies the hypothesis of the Integral Test. Note that the point \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b has coordinates (\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)) for each \ud835\udc5b = 1, 2, 3, 4. Let us first try to approximate the definite integral \u222b\ufe01 4 1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 using the rectangles drawn in Figure 3.3.1. All rectangles have base length equal to 1. Over the \ud835\udc65-interval [\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc5b+ 1], the height of the taller rectangle is given by the height of the point \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b and equals \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b). The height of the shorter rectangle is given by the height of the point \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b+1 and equals \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b + 1). The sum of the areas of the three taller rectangles is equal to 1 \u00b7\ud835\udc53(1) + 1\u00b7\ud835\udc53(2) + 1\u00b7\ud835\udc53(3), and this sum is an overestimate of the definite integral \u222b\ufe01 4 1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. The sum of the areas of the three shorter rectangles is equal to 1 \u00b7\ud835\udc53(2) + 1\u00b7\ud835\udc53(3) + 1\u00b7\ud835\udc53(4), and this sum is an underestimate of the definite integral \u222b\ufe01 4 1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65. Hence we can conclude that \ud835\udc53(2) + \ud835\udc53(3) + \ud835\udc53(4) \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 4 1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264 \ud835\udc53(1) + \ud835\udc53(2) + \ud835\udc53(3). More generally, we can conclude that \ud835\udc53(2) + \ud835\udc53(3) + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a) \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc5a 1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264 \ud835\udc53(1) + \ud835\udc53(2) + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a \u22121) (3.1) 198 Chapter 3 Numerical Series for every positive integer \ud835\udc5a \u22652.

For example, inequalities in (3.1) will need to be changed to \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58 + 1) +\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58 + 2) +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a) \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58) + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58 + 1) +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a \u22121) (3.4) for every positive integer \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc58 + 1. The Monotone Convergence Theorem will now tell us whether the tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) converges or diverges. The convergence or divergence of the orig- inal series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) now follows from the Tail Convergence Theorem or the Tail Divergence Theorem. Compared to other convergence tests, the Integral Test takes a bit more effort to apply. Not only do we need to compute an improper integral, we must also verify that the function that we integrate is continuous, positive, and decreasing on an infinite interval. In practice, the Integral Test is usually used as a last resort! Example 3.3.4 Let us consider the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 ln(\ud835\udc5b) \ud835\udc5b . We can express this series as \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b), where \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = ln(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc65 . \ud835\udc53 is clearly continuous and positive when \ud835\udc65 \u22651. To check whether \ud835\udc53 is decreasing, we compute its derivative and get \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \u2212ln \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc652 . 200 Chapter 3 Numerical Series We note that \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 0 if \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) > 0 if 0 < \ud835\udc65 < \ud835\udc52, and \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) < 0 if \ud835\udc65 > \ud835\udc52. Hence we conclude that \ud835\udc53 is decreasing on the interval [\ud835\udc52, \u221e). Since \ud835\udc52 \u22482.72, we can use the Integral Test with\ud835\udc58 = 3. (This is because \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) will be decreasing on the subinterval [3, \u221e) \u2282[\ud835\udc52, \u221e).) It only remains to compute the corresponding improper integral. \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 3 ln(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc4f\u2192\u221e (ln(\ud835\udc65))2 2 ]\ufe02\ud835\udc4f 3 = lim \ud835\udc4f\u2192\u221e (\ufe02(ln(\ud835\udc4f))2 2 \u2212(ln(3))2 2 )\ufe02 = \u221e. Hence the series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 ln(\ud835\udc5b) \ud835\udc5b diverges by the Integral Test. REMARK If we try to apply the Divergence Test (Corollary 3.2.6) to the last series, then we get lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e ln(\ud835\udc5b) \ud835\udc5b L\u2032HR= lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1/\ud835\udc5b 1 = 0. Note that the hypothesis of the Divergence Test is not satisfied, and hence the Divergence Test does not give any information regarding this infinite series. Corollary 3.3.5 (p-Series Test) Let \ud835\udc5d be a real number. An infinite series of the form \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d is called a \ud835\udc5d-series.

Note that the hypothesis of the Divergence Test is not satisfied, and hence the Divergence Test does not give any information regarding this infinite series. Corollary 3.3.5 (p-Series Test) Let \ud835\udc5d be a real number. An infinite series of the form \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d is called a \ud835\udc5d-series. (i) If \ud835\udc5d >1, then the corresponding \ud835\udc5d-series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d converges. (ii) If \ud835\udc5d \u22641, then the corresponding \ud835\udc5d-series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d diverges. Proof: If \ud835\udc5d <0, then let \ud835\udc5e = \u2212\ud835\udc5d. We note that \ud835\udc5e is a positive real number. It follows that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc5d = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5e = \u221e. If \ud835\udc5d = 0, then lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b0 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 = 1. In both cases, the \ud835\udc5d-series diverges by the Divergence Test (Corollary 3.2.6). If \ud835\udc5d > 0, then \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d is continuous, positive, and decreasing on the interval [1 , \u221e). Thus we can apply the Integral Test to \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) with \ud835\udc58 = 1. Now we recall that the improper integral of the form \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 is called a \ud835\udc5d-integral. We already know that such a \ud835\udc5d-integral converges if and only if \ud835\udc5d >1. It follows from the Integral Test that the \ud835\udc5d-series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d converges when \ud835\udc5d >1 and diverges when 0 < \ud835\udc5d\u22641. Section 3.3 Integral Test 201 Example 3.3.6 (i) The infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 is a \ud835\udc5d-series with \ud835\udc5d = 2 > 1. Hence it converges by the \ud835\udc5d-Series Test. (ii) The infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1\u221a\ud835\udc5b is a \ud835\udc5d-series with \ud835\udc5d = 1 2 \u22641. Hence it diverges by the \ud835\udc5d-Series Test. REMARK We note that the sum of an infinite series is generally not equal to the value of the cor- responding improper integral. For example, \u222b\ufe01 \u221e 1 1 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 1, whereas one can use advanced calculus techniques to compute that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 = \ud835\udf0b2 6 \u22481.645. Suppose that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) converges to \ud835\udc46 \u2208R. If we use the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a as an estimate of the sum \ud835\udc46 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b), then the error in this estimate is given by the tail \ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) \u2212 \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc5a+1 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a + 1) +\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a + 2) +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) satisfies the hypothesis of the Integral Test, then we can obtain both upper and lower bounds on this error using improper integrals.

Then we require \ud835\udc5a to be large enough so that the inequality \ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u22640.001 holds. If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc652 , then \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) satisfies the hypothesis of the Integral Test Estimation Theorem with \ud835\udc58 = 1. By the second inequality of (3.5), we have \ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u2264 \u222b\ufe01 \u221e \ud835\udc5a 1 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = lim \ud835\udc4f\u2192\u221e [\ufe02 \u22121 \ud835\udc65 ]\ufe02\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc5a = lim \ud835\udc4f\u2192\u221e (\ufe02 1 \ud835\udc5a \u22121 \ud835\udc4f )\ufe02 = 1 \ud835\udc5a. Section 3.3 Integral Test 203 If we had 1 \ud835\udc5a \u22640.001, then we could conclude that \ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u2264 1 \ud835\udc5a \u22640.001. Thus we will need 1 \ud835\udc5a \u2264 0.001 = 1 1000, which is equivalent to \ud835\udc5a \u22651000. Hence adding the first 1 , 000 terms of the series will give an estimate that has error at most 0 .001. Section 3.3 Problems 3.3.1. Use the Integral Test to determine whether each of the following series converges or diverges. (a) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc5b3 (b) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 1 \ud835\udc5b(ln \ud835\udc5b) (c) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 1 \ud835\udc5b(ln \ud835\udc5b)4/3 3.3.2. Determine all strictly positive real values of \ud835\udc5d so that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5dln(\ud835\udc5b) converges. 3.3.3. How many terms are needed to estimate the sum \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc5b3 with an error that is less than 10\u22125? 3.3.4. Prove or disprove (i.e., provide a counterexample to) the following statements. (a) If \u221e\u2211\ufe00 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e2 \ud835\udc5b converges and \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b > 0 for all \ud835\udc5b, then \u221e\u2211\ufe00 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b also converges. (b) If \u221e\u2211\ufe00 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b and \u221e\u2211\ufe00 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b both diverge, then \u221e\u2211\ufe00 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b diverges too. 3.3.5. The integral test makes a qualitative connection between the convergence properties of a sum and an integral; the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, \ud835\udc4f\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58=\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58) \u2248 \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 + 1 2 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4f) + \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e) )\ufe02 + 1 12 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc4f) \u2212\ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc4e) )\ufe02 provides a quantitative connection.

Section 3.4 Comparison Test and Limit Comparison Test 205 3.4 Comparison Test and Limit Comparison Test In this section, we present two more convergence tests that we can apply to eventually positive series. Theorem 3.4.1 (Comparison Test) Let \ud835\udc58 be a positive integer. Suppose that {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 and {\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 are two sequences satisfying 0 \u2264\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u2264\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc58. (i) If \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b converges, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges too. (ii) If \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b diverges too. Proof: We first note that (i) and (ii) are contrapositives of one another. Thus it is enough to prove one of them. Let us prove (ii). Suppose that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges. By part (ii) of the Tail Divergence Theorem (Corollary 3.2.4), we can conlude that its tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges too. Now we note that this tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b is a positive series. By Lemma 3.3.2, this tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b must diverge to \u221e. Let \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of this tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b, where \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc58. Then we have lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = \u221e. Next consider the corresponding tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b and its \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b, where \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc58. Since \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u2264\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc58 by our hypothesis, we must have \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a \u2264\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a for every \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc58. By taking limits of both sides of the last inequality as \ud835\udc5a \u2192\u221e, we conclude that \u221e= lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a \u2264 lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a. Thus we must have \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b = lim\ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a = \u221e. By part (i) of the Tail Divergence Theorem, \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b must diverge too. Example 3.4.2 Determine whether each of the following series",

Since \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 is a \ud835\udc5d-series with \ud835\udc5d = 2 > 1, \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 converges by the \ud835\udc5d-Series Test (Corollary 3.3.5). By Comparison Test, \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3 + 7 converges too.

Unlike the Comparison Test, our new test does not involve verifying any set of inequalities, and hence is easier to apply in many situations. Before we state the new test, let us keep in mind that the limit of a positive (or nonnegative) sequence cannot be a strictly negative real number. Theorem 3.4.3 (Limit Comparison Test) Let \ud835\udc58 be a positive integer. Suppose that {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 and {\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 are two sequences satisfying \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u22650 and \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b > 0 for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc58. Let \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b . Then there are only four possibilities. (i) If 0 < \ud835\udc3f <\u221e, then either \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b and \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b both converge or both diverge. (ii) If \ud835\udc3f = 0, then there is a positive integer \ud835\udc57 such that \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b < \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265 \ud835\udc57. Consequently, if \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b converges, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges too. If \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b diverges too. (iii) If \ud835\udc3f = \u221e, then there is a positive integer \ud835\udc57 such that \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b > \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265 \ud835\udc57. Consequently, if \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b converges too.

(iv) If we know that the limit \ud835\udc3f does not exist, then no conclusion can be drawn solely from that knowledge. Section 3.4 Comparison Test and Limit Comparison Test 207 Proof: We will only sketch the proof of part (i) and omit the proofs of the other parts. Suppose that 0 < \ud835\udc3f < \u221e. Then there are positive real constants \ud835\udc36 and \ud835\udc37 such that \ud835\udc36 < \ud835\udc3f < \ud835\udc37. Since lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc3f, there is a positive integer \ud835\udc57 \u2265\ud835\udc58 such that \ud835\udc36 <\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b < \ud835\udc37 for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc57. It follows that \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b < \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b < \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc57. By summing all three sides of the last inequalities, we obtain \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b < \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b < \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b (3.6) for every integer \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc57. If one of \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b and \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5b converges or diverges then we can use the inequalities in (3.6) and the Comparison Test to prove that the other series converges or diverges too. To reiterate, an advantage that the Limit Comparison Test has over the Comparison Test is that we don\u2019t need to come up with delicate inequalities involving complicated sequences. Example 3.4.4 Consider the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b3 \u2212\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b4 + 7. First we note that \ud835\udc5b3 \u2212\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b4 + 7 \u22650 for every \ud835\udc5b \u22651 and hence our series is nonnegative. Asymptotically, as \ud835\udc5b \u2192\u221e, the quotient \ud835\udc5b3 \u2212\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b4 + 7 is similar to \ud835\udc5b3 \ud835\udc5b4 = 1 \ud835\udc5b after we ignore the lower order terms. Thus it makes sense to compare our series against the strictly positive series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b using the Limit Comparison Test. We recall that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b diverges by the \ud835\udc5d-Series Test (Corollary 3.3.5) because it is a \ud835\udc5d-series with \ud835\udc5d = 1 \u22641. We can now compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b3\u2212\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b4+7 )\ufe01 1/\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b4 \u2212\ud835\udc5b2 \ud835\udc5b4 + 7 = 1. Since 0 < \ud835\udc3f= 1 < \u221e, we can conclude that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b3 \u2212\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b4 + 7 must diverge too by part (i) of the Limit Comparison Test. REMARK Let us see if we can apply the Comparison Test to the series in the previous example. We can deduce that 0 \u2264\ud835\udc5b3 \u2212\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b4 + 7 < \ud835\udc5b3 \ud835\udc5b4 + 7 < \ud835\udc5b3 \ud835\udc5b4 = 1 \ud835\udc5b for every \ud835\udc5b \u22651.

But the bigger series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b diverges, so the Comparison Test cannot be applied to these inequalities. The inequalities are simply pointing the wrong way! 208 Chapter 3 Numerical Series Example 3.4.5 Consider the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 2\ud835\udc5b \u22121 3\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc5b. Clearly, it is a strictly positive series. Asymptot- ically, as \ud835\udc5b \u2192\u221e, the quotient 2\ud835\udc5b \u22121 3\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc5b is similar to 2\ud835\udc5b 3\ud835\udc5b = (\ufe022 3 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b after we ignore the lower order terms. (We note that 3 \ud835\udc5b >> \ud835\udc5b as \ud835\udc5b \u2192\u221e.) Thus it makes sense to compare our series against another strictly positive series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\ufe022 3 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b using the Limit Comparison Test. We note that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\ufe022 3 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b converges by the Geometric Series Test (Theorem 3.1.11) since it is a geometric series with ratio \ud835\udc65 = 2 3 and |\ud835\udc65|= 2 3 < 1. We can now compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ufe01 2\ud835\udc5b\u22121 3\ud835\udc5b+\ud835\udc5b )\ufe01 2\ud835\udc5b/3\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 6\ud835\udc5b \u22123\ud835\udc5b 6\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \u2212 1 2\ud835\udc5b 1 + \ud835\udc5b 3\ud835\udc5b = 1 \u22120 1 + 0 = 1. Since 0 < \ud835\udc3f= 1 < \u221e, we can conclude that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 2\ud835\udc5b \u22121 3\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc5b must converge too by part (i) of the Limit Comparison Test. Example 3.4.6 Consider the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (ln(\ud835\udc5b))3 \u221a\ud835\udc5b . First we note that (ln(\ud835\udc5b))3 \u221a\ud835\udc5b \u22650 for every \ud835\udc5b \u22651 and hence our series is nonnegative. Let us compare this series against a strictly positive series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1\u221a\ud835\udc5b using the Limit Comparison Test. We know that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1\u221a\ud835\udc5b is a \ud835\udc5d-series with \ud835\udc5d = 1 2 \u22641, and hence it diverges by the\ud835\udc5d-Series Test (Corollary 3.3.5). We can now compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ufe01 (ln(\ud835\udc5b))3 \u221a\ud835\udc5b )\ufe01 1/\u221a\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (ln(\ud835\udc5b))3 = \u221e. Since the \u201cbottom\u201d series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1\u221a\ud835\udc5b diverges, the \u201ctop\u201d series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (ln(\ud835\udc5b))3 \u221a\ud835\udc5b must also diverge by part (iii) of the Limit Comparison Test.

An alternating series is an infinite series that is in one of the following two forms: (i) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4e1 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2 + \ud835\udc4e3 \u2212\ud835\udc4e4 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, or (ii) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = \u2212\ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 \u2212\ud835\udc4e3 + \ud835\udc4e4 \u2212\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = \u2212(\ud835\udc4e1 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2 + \ud835\udc4e3 \u2212\ud835\udc4e4 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7) = \u2212 \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Since \ud835\udc5b \u22121 and \ud835\udc5b + 1 have the same parity, we always have (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121 = (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b+1 so that we can write an alternating series of the first form as \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b+1\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Example 3.5.2 The infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121 \ud835\udc5b = 1 \u22121 2 + 1 3 \u22121 4 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 is alternating, while the",

Example 3.5.2 The infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121 \ud835\udc5b = 1 \u22121 2 + 1 3 \u22121 4 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 is alternating, while the infinite series 1 \u22121 2 \u22121 3 + 1 4 + 1 5 \u22121 6 \u22121 7 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 is not alternating. Since an alternating series of the second form is just the negative of an alternating series of the first form, we can deduce the following. Lemma 3.5.3 An alternating series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges (to a real number\ud835\udc46) if and only if its negative \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges (to \u2212\ud835\udc46). Proof: Our lemma can be viewed as a special case of part (i) of Theorem 3.2.1, where \ud835\udc50 = \u22121. Let \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sums of \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b and \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b, respectively. Then \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a and hence lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = \u2212 lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a. It follows that lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a exists if and only if lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a exists. Section 3.5 Alternating Series Test 211 Our main theorem in this section is the following convergence test for alternating series, which is due to the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716). Theorem 3.5.4 (Alternating Series Test) Let {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 be a sequence satisfying the following two conditions. (i) lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = 0. (ii) There is a positive integer \ud835\udc58 such that \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 > 0 for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265 \ud835\udc58. In other words, {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 is eventually decreasing (or eventually non-increasing) and eventually strictly positive. Then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b and \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b both converge. Proof: Without loss of generality, let us assume that \ud835\udc58 = 1. In particular, this means that every \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b will be positive. By the previous lemma, it is enough to prove that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges. Let \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of the alternating series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Consider the sequence of even-indexed partial sums: {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1 = {\ud835\udc462, \ud835\udc464, \ud835\udc466, \ud835\udc468, . . .}. For every integer\ud835\udc57 \u22651, we have \ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+1 \u2265\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+2 by our hypothesis (ii) (since we are assuming that \ud835\udc58 = 1). It follows that \ud835\udc462(\ud835\udc57+1) \u2212\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 = (\u22121)2\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+1 + (\u22121)2\ud835\udc57+1\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+2 = \ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+1 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+2 \u22650 for every integer \ud835\udc57 \u22651. Hence {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1 is an increasing (or non-decreasing) sequence. For every integer \ud835\udc57 \u22651, we can write \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc4e1 \u2212(\ud835\udc4e2 \u2212\ud835\udc4e3)\u23df \u23de \u22650 \u2212(\ud835\udc4e4 \u2212\ud835\udc4e5)\u23df \u23de \u22650 \u2212\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2212 (\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57\u22122 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57\u22121)\u23df \u23de \u22650 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57\u23df \u23de >0 . Hence \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 < \ud835\udc4e1 for every integer \ud835\udc57 \u22651, and thus the sequence {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1 is bounded from above.",

It follows that \ud835\udc462(\ud835\udc57+1) \u2212\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 = (\u22121)2\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+1 + (\u22121)2\ud835\udc57+1\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+2 = \ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+1 \u2212\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+2 \u22650 for every integer \ud835\udc57 \u22651.

(An upper bound is given by \ud835\udc4e1.) By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the se- quence {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1 converges, and lim \ud835\udc57\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc46, where \ud835\udc46 is the least upper bound of {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1. Next consider the the sequence of odd-indexed partial sums: {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u22121}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1 = {\ud835\udc461, \ud835\udc463, \ud835\udc465, \ud835\udc467, . . .}. We note that \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u22121 = \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 \u2212(\u22121)2\ud835\udc57\u22121\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 + \ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57 for every integer \ud835\udc57 \u22651. By our hypothesis (i), we can deduce that lim \ud835\udc57\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57 = 0. It follows that lim \ud835\udc57\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u22121 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 + \ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57) = \ud835\udc46 + 0 = \ud835\udc46. 212 Chapter 3 Numerical Series Thus we have shown that {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1 and {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u22121}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1 both converge to the same limit \ud835\udc46. Let us now use the precise definition of the limit of a sequence. Let \ud835\udf16 >0 be an arbitrary positive real number. We know that lim \ud835\udc57\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u22121 = \ud835\udc46. Hence there is a cutoff \ud835\udc361 such that |\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u22121 \u2212\ud835\udc46|< \ud835\udf16 if \ud835\udc57 > \ud835\udc361. (3.7) We also know that lim \ud835\udc57\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc46. Hence there is a cutoff \ud835\udc362 such that |\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 \u2212\ud835\udc46|< \ud835\udf16 if \ud835\udc57 > \ud835\udc362. (3.8) Now let \ud835\udc36 = max{2\ud835\udc361 \u22121, 2\ud835\udc362}. We will show below that \ud835\udc36 is a cutoff for the limit of the sequence {\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a}\u221e \ud835\udc5a=1. A positive integer \ud835\udc5a is either odd or even, i.e., either \ud835\udc5a = 2 \ud835\udc57 \u22121 or \ud835\udc5a = 2 \ud835\udc57 for some positive integer \ud835\udc57. Let us consider these two cases separately. \u2022 Suppose that \ud835\udc5a = 2\ud835\udc57 \u22121. If \ud835\udc5a > \ud835\udc36, then \ud835\udc5a >2\ud835\udc361 \u22121 and hence 2 \ud835\udc57 \u22121 > 2\ud835\udc361 \u22121, which gives us \ud835\udc57 > \ud835\udc361. Thus (3.7) implies that |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u2212\ud835\udc46|= |\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u22121 \u2212\ud835\udc46|< \ud835\udf16. \u2022 Suppose that \ud835\udc5a = 2\ud835\udc57. If \ud835\udc5a > \ud835\udc36, then \ud835\udc5a >2\ud835\udc362 and hence 2 \ud835\udc57 >2\ud835\udc362, which gives us \ud835\udc57 > \ud835\udc362. Thus (3.8) implies that |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u2212\ud835\udc46|= |\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 \u2212\ud835\udc46|< \ud835\udf16. In both cases, if \ud835\udc5a > \ud835\udc36, then |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u2212\ud835\udc46|< \ud835\udf16. Therefore, lim \ud835\udc5a\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc46, and \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges to \ud835\udc46.

REMARK If an alternating series fails the Alternating Series Test, then we may be able to apply the Divergence Test (Corollary 3.2.6).

Let \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of \ud835\udc46 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Let \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum of \ud835\udc47 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Suppose that \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc58, where \ud835\udc58 is the positive integer in the hypothesis (ii) of the Alternating Series Test. Then we can conclude the following. (1) |\ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a|\u2264 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+1 and |\ud835\udc47 \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a|\u2264 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+1. (2) If \ud835\udc5a is even, then \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a is an underestimate of \ud835\udc46 and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a is an overestimate of \ud835\udc47. (3) If \ud835\udc5a is odd, then \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a is an overestimate of \ud835\udc46 and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a is an underestimate of \ud835\udc47. Proof: We will only look at the alternating series of the first form \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b and its partial sums \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a. The proof for \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b is similar and is omitted. Without loss of generality, let us assume that\ud835\udc58 = 1. In particular, this means that every \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b will be positive. Let us prove parts (2) and (3) first. We saw in the proof of the Alternating Series Test and the Remark right after that proof that \ud835\udc46 is the least upper bound of {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1 and the greatest lower bound of {\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u22121}\u221e \ud835\udc57=1. It immediately follows that \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 \u2264\ud835\udc46 \u2264\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u2032\u22121 (3.9) for every pair of positive integers \ud835\udc57 and \ud835\udc57\u2032. Hence \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 is an underestimate and \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u2032\u22121 is an overestimate of \ud835\udc46 for every pair of positive integers \ud835\udc57 and \ud835\udc57\u2032. We have thus proved parts (2) and (3). To prove part (1), we need to consider two separate cases. \u2022 Suppose that \ud835\udc5a is even, i.e., \ud835\udc5a = 2\ud835\udc57 for some positive integer \ud835\udc57. By (3.9), the distance between \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 and \ud835\udc46 is less than (or equal to) the distance between \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57 and \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u2032\u22121. If we choose \ud835\udc57\u2032= \ud835\udc57 + 1, then we have |\ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a|= |\ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57|\u2264| \ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57\u2032\u22121 \u2212\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57|= |\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57+1 \u2212\ud835\udc462\ud835\udc57|= |(\u22121)2\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+1|= \ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc57+1 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+1. \u2022 Suppose that \ud835\udc5a is odd, i.e., \ud835\udc5a = 2 \ud835\udc57 \u22121 for some positive integer \ud835\udc57.

Solution: We can easily check that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 10\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! = 0, and that 1 10\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! > 1 10\ud835\udc5b+1 (\ud835\udc5b + 1)! > 0 for every \ud835\udc5b \u22651. Thus we can apply the Alternating Series Test (with \ud835\udc58 = 1) to conclude that our series converges to some real number \ud835\udc46. By part (1) of the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem, the error in the estimate made by the partial sum \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a satisfies the inequality |error |= |\ud835\udc46 \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a|\u2264 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a+1 = 1 10\ud835\udc5a+1(\ud835\udc5a + 1)!. Thus we want to find an integer \ud835\udc5a such that the inequality 1 10\ud835\udc5a+1(\ud835\udc5a + 1)! \u22640.000005 is satisfied. Using a computer, we can check that 1 10\ud835\udc5a+1(\ud835\udc5a + 1)! = \u23a7 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 1 103(3)! \u22480.00017 when \ud835\udc5a = 2, 1 104(4)! \u22480.000004 when \ud835\udc5a = 3. Thus \ud835\udc5a = 3 satisfies our inequality and so three terms are enough. Example 3.5.10 Is the 121st partial sum of \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22121 3\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b \u00b74\ud835\udc5b an overestimate or an underestimate of the actual sum? Solution: We first check that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b (\ufe023 4 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b = 0, and that 1 \ud835\udc5b (\ufe023 4 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b > 1 \ud835\udc5b + 1 (\ufe023 4 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b+1 > 0 for every integer \ud835\udc5b \u22651. Thus we can apply the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem (with \ud835\udc58 = 1). Since 121 is an odd integer (and 121 \u22651), part (3) of the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem implies that \ud835\udc46121 is an overestimate of the actual sum. 216 Chapter 3 Numerical Series Section 3.5 Problems 3.5.1.

Section 3.6 Absolute and Conditional Convergence 217 3.6 Absolute and Conditional Convergence So far we have examined convergence tests for eventually positive series and a convergence test for alternating series. In this section, we study a convergence test that can be applied to generic series that have a non-alternating assortment of positive and negative terms. Just like for improper integrals, we will use the absolute values and discuss absolute convergence! Definition 3.6.1 Absolute Convergence Given an infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b, its absolutization is the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|. We say that the series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges absolutely if its absolutization \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|converges. REMARK Note that if a series only has positive (or nonnegative) terms then absolute convergence is the same as ordinary convergence since \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|= \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b. Example 3.6.2 Consider the alternating series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b2 . It converges absolutely since its absolutization \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b2 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b2 is a convergent \ud835\udc5d-series by the \ud835\udc5d-Series Test (\ud835\udc5d = 2 > 1). We will show that absolute convergence always implies ordinary convergence. Theorem 3.6.3 (Absolute Convergence Test) If \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|converges, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges.

By the Absolute Convergence Test, to prove that a generic infinite series converges, we can try to prove that it converges absolutely instead.

To determine which of the three possibilities occur, we can try the following. Step 1: Try the Divergence Test (Corollary 3.2.6) to see whether the series diverges. Step 2. Check for the absolute convergence by applying appropriate convergence tests to the absolutization of our series. Step 3: Check for the conditional convergence by applying the Alternating Series Test (Theorem 3.5.4). Doing Step 2 before Step 3 is more efficient since if the series converges absolutely then we are done. On the other hand, even if an alternating series converges by the Alternating Series Test, we still need to check whether the series converges absolutely. Example 3.6.7 Determine whether each of the following series diverges, converges absolutely, or converges conditionally. (i) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b4\ud835\udc5b 3\ud835\udc5b (ii) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5b (iii) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 Solution: (i) Let us apply the Divergence Test (Corollary 3.2.6) first. Note that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 4\ud835\udc5b 3\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ufe024 3 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b = \u221e. Hence, if we add alternating signs, then lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b4\ud835\udc5b 3\ud835\udc5b does not exist. By the Divergence Test, our series diverges. 220 Chapter 3 Numerical Series (ii) Note that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ufe01\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udf0b )\ufe01\ud835\udc5b = 0, since 0 < \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udf0b < 1. Thus the Divergence Test fails. We also note that this series only has positive terms. Thus absolute convergence is equivalent to ordinary convergence for this series. In fact, our series is a geometric series with ratio \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udf0b . Since \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udf0b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udf0b < 1, our series converges absolutely by the Geometric Series Test. (iii) Let us apply the Divergence Test first. Dividing the numerator and the denominator by \ud835\udc5b, we conclude that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u221a\ufe01 1 + 1 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b1/2 = 0. Since we have \u2212 \u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 \u2264(\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 \u2264 \u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 for every integer \ud835\udc5b \u22651, the Squeeze Theorem implies that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 = 0. Thus the Divergence Test fails. Next, let us check for absolute convergence. The absolutization of our series is \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u221a \ud835\udc5b2",

Thus the Divergence Test fails. Next, let us check for absolute convergence. The absolutization of our series is \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 , which is clearly a strictly positive series. Asymptotically, as \ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e, the general term\u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 is similar to \u221a \ud835\udc5b2 \ud835\udc5b3/2 = 1\u221a\ud835\udc5b after we ignore the lower order terms. Thus it makes sense to compare our series against the strictly positive series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1\u221a\ud835\udc5b using the Limit Comparison Test. We note that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1\u221a\ud835\udc5b diverges by the \ud835\udc5d-Series Test because it is a \ud835\udc5d- series with \ud835\udc5d = 1 2 \u22641. We can now compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ufe01\u221a \ud835\udc5b2+\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 )\ufe01 1/\u221a\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u221a\ufe02 1 + 1 \ud835\udc5b = 1. Since 0 < \ud835\udc3f= 1 < \u221e, we conclude that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 must diverge too by part (i) of the Limit Comparison Test. Hence our series does not converge absolutely. Finally, let us check for conditional convergence using the Alternating Series Test. We already saw that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u221a \ud835\udc5b2 + \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b3/2 = 0, and thus hypothesis (i) of the Alternating Series Test is satisfied.

Suppose that {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b}\u221e \ud835\udc5b=1 is a sequence satisfying \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u0338= 0 for every \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc58. Let \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2. Further, suppose that either \ud835\udc3f \u2208R or \ud835\udc3f = \u221e. (i) If \ud835\udc3f <1, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges absolutely. (ii) If \ud835\udc3f >1 or if \ud835\udc3f = \u221e, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges. (iii) If we know that \ud835\udc3f = 1, then no conclusion can be drawn solely from that knowledge. Proof: (i) Suppose that \ud835\udc3f < 1. We are done with this part if we can prove that the absolutization \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|converges. We will prove this convergence by comparing a tail of the absolutization with a suitable geometric series. Since there is a strictly positive distance between \ud835\udc3f and 1, we can choose a strictly positive real number \ud835\udc65 > 0 such that \ud835\udc3f < \ud835\udc65 < 1. Similarly, since there is a strictly positive distance between \ud835\udc3f and \ud835\udc65, we can choose a strictly positive real number \ud835\udf16 >0 such that \ud835\udc3f < \ud835\udc3f+ \ud835\udf16 < \ud835\udc65. By the precise definition of the limit \ud835\udc3f, there is a positive integer cutoff \ud835\udc41 \u2265\ud835\udc58 (correspond- ing to the chosen \ud835\udf16) such that \ud835\udc5b > \ud835\udc41 =\u21d2 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u2212\ud835\udc3f \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 < \ud835\udf16 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc3f \u2212\ud835\udf16 < \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 < \ud835\udc3f+ \ud835\udf16 =\u21d2 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 < \ud835\udc3f+ \ud835\udf16 < \ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 < \ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1|< |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|\ud835\udc65. It follows that |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+2|< |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|\ud835\udc65, 224 Chapter 3 Numerical Series |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+3|< |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+2|\ud835\udc65 <|\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|\ud835\udc652, |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+4|< |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+3|\ud835\udc65 <|\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|\ud835\udc653, and more generally, |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+\ud835\udc57|< |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\u22121 for every integer \ud835\udc57 \u22651. Adding up all of these inequalities, we can conclude that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc41+1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b| = |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|+ |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+2|+ |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+3|+ |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+4|+ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|+ |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|\ud835\udc65 + |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|\ud835\udc652 + |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|\ud835\udc653 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57=0 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41+1|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57. The last series is a geometric series with ratio \ud835\udc65 that satisfies |\ud835\udc65|= \ud835\udc65 <1. By the Geometric Series Test (Theorem 3.1.11), this geometric series converges. By the Comparison Test (Theorem 3.4.1), the tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc41+1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|converges too. By part (ii) of the Tail Convergence Theorem (Theorem 3.2.3), \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|must converge as well. Therefore, \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges absolutely. (ii) Suppose that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 > 1 or lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = \u221e.

(i) If \ud835\udc3f <1, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges absolutely. (ii) If \ud835\udc3f >1 or if \ud835\udc3f = \u221e, then \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b diverges. (iii) If we know that \ud835\udc3f = 1, then no conclusion can be drawn solely from that knowledge. Proof: Our proof is very similar to the proof of the Ratio Test. (i) Suppose that \ud835\udc3f <1. We are done with this part if we can prove that the absolutization \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|converges. We will prove this convergence by comparing a tail of the absolutization with a suitable geometric series. Since there is a strictly positive distance between \ud835\udc3f and 1, we can choose a strictly positive real number \ud835\udc65 > 0 such that \ud835\udc3f < \ud835\udc65 < 1. Similarly, since there is a strictly positive distance between \ud835\udc3f and \ud835\udc65, we can choose a strictly positive real number \ud835\udf16 >0 such that \ud835\udc3f < \ud835\udc3f+ \ud835\udf16 < \ud835\udc65. By the precise definition of the limit \ud835\udc3f, there is a positive integer cutoff \ud835\udc41 (corresponding to the chosen \ud835\udf16) such that \ud835\udc5b > \ud835\udc41 =\u21d2 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|\u2212\ud835\udc3f \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 < \ud835\udf16 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc3f \u2212\ud835\udf16 < \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|< \ud835\udc3f+ \ud835\udf16 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|< \ud835\udc3f+ \ud835\udf16 < \ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|< \ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|< \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b, where the last implication holds because \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|\u2265 0.",

Summing over all integers \ud835\udc5b satisfying \ud835\udc5b > \ud835\udc41, we obtain 0 \u2264 \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc41+1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b| < \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc41+1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b. The last series is a geometric series with ratio \ud835\udc65 that satisfies |\ud835\udc65|= \ud835\udc65 <1. By the Geometric Series Test (Theorem 3.1.11), this geometric series converges. By the Comparison Test (Theorem 3.4.1), the tail \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc41+1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|converges too. By part (ii) of the Tail Convergence Theorem (Theorem 3.4.1), \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|must converge as well. Therefore, \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b converges absolutely. Section 3.7 Ratio Test and Root Test 227 (ii) Suppose that lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|> 1 or lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|= \u221e. Then eventually we will have \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|> 1, i.e., there is some integer cutoff\ud835\udc41\u2032such that \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|> 1 for every integer\ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc41\u2032. Thus we will have |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|> 1\ud835\udc5b = 1 for every integer \ud835\udc5b \u2265\ud835\udc41\u2032. This implies that the sizes of the terms are strictly greater than 1 eventually, and hence lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u0338= 0. Therefore, our series diverges by the Divergence Test (Corollary 3.2.6). (iii) Consider an arbitrary \ud835\udc5d-series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d . For every \ud835\udc5d \u2208R, we can compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b|= lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b \u221a\ufe00 |\ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc5d|= lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc5d/\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ud835\udc5b1/\ud835\udc5b)\u2212\ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc40\u2212\ud835\udc5d, where \ud835\udc40 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b1/\ud835\udc5b. Now we note that ln(\ud835\udc40) = ln (\ufe01 lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b1/\ud835\udc5b )\ufe01 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e ln(\ud835\udc5b1/\ud835\udc5b) = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e ln(\ud835\udc5b) \ud835\udc5b L\u2032HR= lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1/\ud835\udc5b 1 = 0. It follows that \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc52ln(\ud835\udc40) = \ud835\udc520 = 1 and \ud835\udc3f = \ud835\udc40\u2212\ud835\udc5d = 1\u2212\ud835\udc5d = 1. Since the limit \ud835\udc3f is the same for every \ud835\udc5d and there are both convergent and divergent \ud835\udc5d-series, we conclude that the limit \ud835\udc3f provides no information about the convergence. We use the Root Test when all of the terms in a series are raised to the power of \ud835\udc5b. Example 3.7.6 Let us apply the Root Test to the infinite series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc5b + 1 3\ud835\udc5b + 7 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b . We compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ufe02\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc5b + 1 3\ud835\udc5b + 7 )\ufe02\ud835\udc5b\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 )\ufe021/\ud835\udc5b = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b + 1 3\ud835\udc5b + 7 = 1 3 < 1.

Chapter 4 Power Series In the previous chapter, we studied the convergence of infinite sums of real numbers. In this chapter, we will be studying the convergence of infinite sums of functions rather than numbers. More precisely, we will be looking at the convergence of \u201cpower series\u201d, which is a function that is equal to an infinite sum of power functions of the form: \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc5b = 0, 1, 2, . . .), where \ud835\udc65 is a variable and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc4e are constants. Given any power series, its partial sums are finite sums of power functions, and hence polynomials. Therefore we can estimate the values of a convergent power series by evaluating its partial sums which are polynomials. Since the values of polynomials can always be computed in a relatively simple manner (their computations only involve the addition, subtraction and multiplication of real numbers), we can easily estimate the values of a convergent power series. By the end of this chapter, you will have seen that most differentiable functions that you have encountered in your study of calculus thus far are equal to some power series! More- over, you will have learned how to use power series and their partial sums to compute or estimate those basic functions and their limits and integrals. Indeed, your calculators and computer programs employ the same type of power series methods in the background to obtain estimates for the values of \u201ctranscendental\u201d functions like the trigonometric, inverse- trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions. 4.1 Introduction to Power Series Definition 4.1.1 Power Series A power series centred at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e is an infinite series of the form: \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc500",

Such a function defined by a power series is called an analytic function.

When \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, the first term in the summation notation is \ud835\udc500 \u00b700. Now recall from MATH 137 that 0 0 is an indeterminate form and hence is not a real number. Therefore, technically speaking, we should be writing \ud835\udc500 + \ud835\udc501(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e) + \ud835\udc502(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)2 + \ud835\udc503(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)3 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = \ud835\udc500 + \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b. As this is somewhat cumbersome, we will always be setting ( \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)0 = 1 as a notational convention for power series, even when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. Hence every power series converges to \ud835\udc500 when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. This implies that the interval of convergence for any power series is never empty as it always contains the centre point \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. Example 4.1.2 Consider the geometric series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc653 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 , where \ud835\udc4e \u0338= 0. It is a power series centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 where all coefficients are the same, i.e., \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc4e for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b. From the Geometric Series Test, its interval of convergence is the finite interval of length two: (\u22121, 1) = {\ud835\udc65 \u2208R ||\ud835\udc65|< 1}. Example 4.1.3 Find the interval of convergence for \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\ud835\udc65 \u22127)\ud835\udc5b. Solution: Our series is a geometric series with the first term equal to 1 and the ratio equal to \ud835\udc65\u22127. By the Geometric Series Test, our series converges if and only if|ratio|= |\ud835\udc65\u22127|< 1. Note that |\ud835\udc65 \u22127|< 1 \u21d0\u21d2 \u22121 < \ud835\udc65\u22127 < 1 \u21d0\u21d2 6 < \ud835\udc65 <8. Thus our interval of convergence is the interval (6 , 8).

Since our power series is centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0, its interval of convergence contains \ud835\udc65 = 0. Since the power series has factorial terms, we will use the Ratio Test (Theorem 3.7.1). Clearly, every term in our power series is nonzero when \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 0. Thus we can apply the Ratio Test (with \ud835\udc58 = 1) when \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 0.

By the Ratio Test, our power series converges absolutely for all nonzero \ud835\udc65 \u2208R, which means that the interval of covergence is R. The following theorem tells us that the interval of convergence for any power series will always be an interval! Theorem 4.1.5 Given any power series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b, there are only three possibilities. (i) The power series converges only when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. (ii) The power series converges absolutely for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R. (iii) There exists a strictly positive real number \ud835\udc45 such that the power series converges absolutely when |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|< \ud835\udc45, diverges when |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|> \ud835\udc45, and may converge or diverge when |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|= \ud835\udc45. Proof: For simplicity, we will only sketch the proof when our power series is centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0. It will be enough show that if our power series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b converges at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc650 and if |\ud835\udc651|< |\ud835\udc650|, then our power series also converges at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc651. Since \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 0 converges, we must have lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc650\ud835\udc5b = 0 by Theorem 3.2.5 (Necessary Con- dition for Convergence). Therefore, we will have |\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 0 |< 1 eventually. It follows that eventually we will have |\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 1 |= |\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 0 |\u00b7 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 0 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u2264 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 0 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2.

Let \ud835\udc45 be the least upper bound on the set \ud835\udc34 = {|\ud835\udc65|| \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c }. If \ud835\udc45 = 0, then we have case (i). If \ud835\udc45 = \u221e(i.e., there is no real number that bounds \ud835\udc34 from above), then we have case (ii). Otherwise, we have case (iii). REMARK Given any power series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b, there are only six possibilities for its interval of convergence \ud835\udc3c. We could have \ud835\udc3c = {\ud835\udc4e}= [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e], \ud835\udc3c = R = (\u2212\u221e, \u221e), or \ud835\udc3c = (\ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udc45), \ud835\udc3c = [\ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udc45), \ud835\udc3c = (\ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udc45], \ud835\udc3c = [\ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udc45] for some strictly positive real number \ud835\udc45. The power series will converge absolutely on \ud835\udc3c except possibly at the two endpoints \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e \u00b1\ud835\udc45. Definition 4.1.6 Radius of Convergence The strictly positive real number \ud835\udc45 in case (iii) of the previous theorem is called the radius of convergence for the power series. When case (i) holds, we will say that the radius of convergence is 0. When case (ii) holds, we will say that the radius of convergence is \u221e. We can usually apply the Ratio Test to compute the radius and the interval of convergence for a power series. Example 4.1.7 Find the radius and the interval of convergence for the following power series. (i) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 3\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 + 4)\ud835\udc5b \u221a\ud835\udc5b (ii) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc5b! \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b (iii) \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b 4\ud835\udc5b ln(\ud835\udc5b) Solution: (i) Our power series is centred at \ud835\udc65 = \u22124. Note that every term in our series is nonzero when \ud835\udc65 \u0338= \u22124. Thus we can apply the Ratio Test (with \ud835\udc58 = 1) when \ud835\udc65 \u0338= \u22124. We can compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 3\ud835\udc5b+1(\ud835\udc65 + 4)\ud835\udc5b+1 \u221a\ud835\udc5b + 1 \u00b7 \u221a\ud835\udc5b 3\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 + 4)\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u221a\ud835\udc5b\u221a\ud835\udc5b + 1 \u00b73|\ud835\udc65 + 4|= 3|\ud835\udc65 + 4|\u2208 R.

By the Ratio Test, our power series diverges when|\ud835\udc65 \u2212(\u22124)|> 1 3. It follows that our radius of convergence is \ud835\udc45 = 1 3, and our interval of convergence contains the open interval (\ufe02 \u22124 \u22121 3, \u22124 + 1 3 )\ufe02 = (\ufe02 \u221213 3 ,",

If \ud835\udc65 = \u221211 3 , then our power series becomes \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 3\ud835\udc5b(\u221211/3 + 4)\ud835\udc5b \u221a\ud835\udc5b = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 3\ud835\udc5b(1/3)\ud835\udc5b \u221a\ud835\udc5b = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 1\u221a\ud835\udc5b. The last series is a \ud835\udc5d-series with \ud835\udc5d = 1 2 \u22641, and it diverges by the \ud835\udc5d-Series Test (Corol- lary 3.3.5). We conclude that the interval of convergence for our series is [\ufe02 \u221213 3 , \u221211 3 )\ufe02 . (ii) Our power series is centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0. Note that every term in our series is nonzero when \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 0. Thus we can apply the Ratio Test (with \ud835\udc58 = 1) when \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 0. We can compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 (\ud835\udc5b + 1)!\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc5b! \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e (\ud835\udc5b + 1)|\ud835\udc65|= \u221e. for every nonzero \ud835\udc65 \u2208R. By the Ratio Test, our power series diverges for every nonzero \ud835\udc65 \u2208R. Thus the interval of convergence for our power series is a single point, \ud835\udc3c = {0}, and the radius of convergence for our power series is 0.

REMARK The final case of statement (i) is worth a deeper dive. Let \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 be the radius of convergence for a power series function \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). Then the power series for \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) will also have the radius 236 Chapter 4 Power Series of convergence equal to \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 . But their sum \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + (\u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)) = 0, which is the constant zero function, has the radius of convergence equal to \u221e. More generally, you can take any power series function \u210e(\ud835\udc65) with the radius of convergence \ud835\udc45\u210e > \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 , and consider the sum of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) with \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + \u210e(\ud835\udc65), which has the radius of convergence equal to \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 = min{\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 , \ud835\udc45\u210e}= \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 . We can then conclude that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + (\u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + \u210e(\ud835\udc65)) = \u210e(\ud835\udc65) has the radius of convergence equal to \ud835\udc45\u210e. In this way you can get any real number greater than \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 as the radius of convergence for the sum of two power series both of which have the radius of convergence equal to \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53",

We can then conclude that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + (\u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) + \u210e(\ud835\udc65)) = \u210e(\ud835\udc65) has the radius of convergence equal to \ud835\udc45\u210e. In this way you can get any real number greater than \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 as the radius of convergence for the sum of two power series both of which have the radius of convergence equal to \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 . For the rest of this section, we will focus on expressing rational functions as power series. We recall from the Geometric Series Test (Theorem 3.1.11) that \ud835\udc4e 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b, which holds for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R satisfying |\ud835\udc65|< 1. Example 4.2.3 Express \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 3 \u2212\ud835\udc65 as a power series centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0. State the radius and the interval of convergence for the power series that you found. Solution: We can rewrite the quotient as 1 3 \u2212\ud835\udc65 = 1 3 (\ufe02 1 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65 3 )\ufe02 = 1 3 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65 3 , which will be equal to the geometric series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 1 3 (\ufe01\ud835\udc65 3 )\ufe01\ud835\udc5b = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 1 3\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b. By the Geometric Series Test, this series converges if and only if \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\ud835\udc65 3 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 < 1, which is equivalent to |\ud835\udc65|< 3. Thus the interval of convergence is ( \u22123, 3) and the radius of convergence is 3. Example 4.2.4 Express \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc65 + 7 as a power series centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0. State the radius and the interval of convergence for the power series that you found. Solution: We can rewrite the quotient as \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc65 + 7 = \ud835\udc652 7 (\ufe02 1 1 + \ud835\udc65/7 )\ufe02 = \ud835\udc652 (\ufe02 1/7 1 \u2212(\u2212\ud835\udc65/7) )\ufe02 . By the Geometric Series Test, we have 1/7 1 \u2212(\u2212\ud835\udc65/7) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 1 7 (\ufe01 \u2212\ud835\udc65 7 )\ufe01\ud835\udc5b Section 4.2 Representing Functions as Power Series 237 when \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u2212\ud835\udc65 7 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 < 1, or equivalently when|\ud835\udc65|< 7. By part (ii) of Theorem 4.2.2, we can conclude that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 1 7 (\ufe01 \u2212\ud835\udc65 7 )\ufe01\ud835\udc5b = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b 7\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+2 when |\ud835\udc65|< 7. The interval of convergence is ( \u22127, 7) and the radius of convergence is 7. Example 4.2.5 Express \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc65 as a power series centred at \ud835\udc65 = 3. State the radius and the interval of convergence for the power series that you found. Solution: The trick is to add and subtract three! Note that 1 \ud835\udc65 = 1 (\ud835\udc65 \u22123) + 3 = 1 3 (\ufe03 1 1 + \ud835\udc65\u22123 3 )\ufe03 = 1 3 1 \u2212 (\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udc65\u22123 3 )\ufe00.

Theorem 4.3.1 Let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b be a power series function with the radius of convergence \ud835\udc45 >0.

(Compare with the remark after Definition 4.1.1.) Another equivalent way to write the same series for \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) is \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b+1 (\ud835\udc5b + 1)(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b. We will use these alternative forms in the proof of the Generalized Binomial Theorem (Theorem 4.6.5) in Section 4.6 (see equations (4.18) and (4.19)). Although the power series for \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) and \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 all have the same radius of con- vergence, they can have different intervals of convergence. Specifically, they can behave differently at the endpoints \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e \u00b1\ud835\udc45. 244 Chapter 4 Power Series Example 4.3.2 Express \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1 (1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)3 as a power series centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0. State the radius and the interval of convergence for the power series that you found. Solution: From the Geometric Series Test (Theorem 3.1.11), we know that (1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)\u22121 = 1 1 \u2212\ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b if and only if |\ud835\udc65|< 1. Thus the power series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b has the radius of convergence equal to 1. Termwise differentiation now gives (\u22121)(1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)\u22122(\u22121) = (1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)\u22122 = 1 (1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)2 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 when |\ud835\udc65|< 1. Another termwise differentiation gives (\u22122)(1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)\u22123(\u22121) = 2 (1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)3 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121)\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22122 when |\ud835\udc65|< 1. Thus we obtain 1 (1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)3 = 1 2 \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121)\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22122 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) 2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22122 when |\ud835\udc65|< 1. By statement (iii) of Theorem 4.3.1, our power series for \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) has the radius of convergence equal to 1. Let us now check what happens at the endpoints. If \ud835\udc65 = 1, then our power series becomes \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) 2 , which diverges by the Divergence Test (Corollary 3.2.6) since lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) 2 = \u221e. If \ud835\udc65 = \u22121, then our power series becomes \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) 2 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22122, which also diverges by the Divergence Test since lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) 2 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\u22122 does not exist. Therefore, the interval of convergence for our power series for \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) is the interval (\u22121, 1). REMARK Note that the first two terms of \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) 2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22122 are zero. Thus we have the identities: \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) 2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22122 = 0 + 0 + 2(2 \u22121) 2 \ud835\udc652\u22122 + 3(3 \u22121) 2 \ud835\udc653\u22122 + 4(4 \u22121) 2 \ud835\udc654\u22122 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 =",

Theorem 4.3.6 For all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R, we have \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! = 1 + \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc652 2 + \ud835\udc653 6 + \ud835\udc654 24 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 .

From Example 4.1.4, we know that the interval of convergence for \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) is R. Termwise differentiation gives \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 \ud835\udc5b! = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 (\ud835\udc5b \u22121)! = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R.

Section 4.3 Differentiating and Integrating Power Series 249 Proof: Since the series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! converges for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R, we can apply Theorem 3.2.5 (Nec- essary Condition for Convergence) to obtain our conclusion.

We first start with a very useful notational convention. Definition 4.4.1 n-th Derivative Notation The \ud835\udc5b-th derivative of \ud835\udc53 will be denoted by \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc65). In particular, we have \ud835\udc53(1)(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc53(2)(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc65). We define the 0- th derivative of \ud835\udc53 as \ud835\udc53(0)(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65). The \ud835\udc5b-th derivative of \ud835\udc53 evaluated at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e will be denoted by \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc4e). Our first theorem says that a function \ud835\udc53 has a unique power series representation once we fix the centre point of our power series. Theorem 4.4.2 (Uniqueness of Power Series Representation) Suppose that \ud835\udc53 has a power series representation centred at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, i.e., the equality \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b holds for all \ud835\udc65 satisfying |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|< \ud835\udc45, where \ud835\udc45 >0. Then \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc5b! for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b. Proof: First, we note that \ud835\udc500 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc53(0)(\ud835\udc4e) 0! . Termwise differentiation gives \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 0 + \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b\u22121 = \ud835\udc501 + 2\ud835\udc502(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e) + 3\ud835\udc503(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)2 + 4\ud835\udc504(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)3 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . Plugging in \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, we conclude that \ud835\udc501 = \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc53(1)(\ud835\udc4e) 1! . Another termwise differentiation gives \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 0 + 0 + \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=2 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121)(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b\u22122 = 2\ud835\udc502 + 6\ud835\udc503(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e) + 12\ud835\udc504(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . Thus we conclude that \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc4e) = 2\ud835\udc502, which implies that \ud835\udc502 = \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc4e) 2 = \ud835\udc53(2)(\ud835\udc4e) 2! . In general, for any positive integer \ud835\udc58, we will have \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58)(\ud835\udc65) = 0 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 0\u23df \u23de \ud835\udc58 zeroes + \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u22121)(\ud835\udc5b \u22122) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(\ud835\udc5b \u2212(\ud835\udc58 \u22121))(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc58 \u22121)(\ud835\udc58 \u22122) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b71 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)0 + \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58+1 (\ud835\udc58 + 1)\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc58 \u22121) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b72 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . It follows that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58)(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc58 \u22121)(\ud835\udc58 \u22122) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b71, which implies that \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58)(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc58! . Section 4.4 Taylor Series and Taylor Polynomials 251 The previous theorem motivates the following definition. Definition 4.4.3 Taylor and Maclaurin Series Let \ud835\udc53 be differentiable arbitrarily many times at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, i.e., \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc4e) is a well-defined real number for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b. The power series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc5b!

Definition 4.4.3 Taylor and Maclaurin Series Let \ud835\udc53 be differentiable arbitrarily many times at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, i.e., \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc4e) is a well-defined real number for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b. The power series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc5b! (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5b is called the Taylor series for \ud835\udc53 centred at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. In the special case when \ud835\udc4e = 0, the power series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(0) \ud835\udc5b! \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b is called the Maclaurin series for \ud835\udc53. These series are named after an English mathematician Brook Taylor (1685\u20131731) and a Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin (1698\u20131746) who popularized them. Example 4.4.4 Let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc4e = 0. Then \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b, and thus \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(0) = \ud835\udc520 = 1 for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b. Hence the Taylor series for \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 (or the Maclaurin series for \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65) is \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(0) \ud835\udc5b! \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! . In Theorem 4.3.6, we saw that \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 is equal to its Taylor series centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 for every real value \ud835\udc65, i.e., we have \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208R. REMARK By Theorem 4.4.2, if a function \ud835\udc53 is equal to a power series centred at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, then this power series must be equal to the Taylor series for \ud835\udc53 centred at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. However, it is not true that a Taylor series for a function\ud835\udc54 must be equal to \ud835\udc54 on its interval of convergence. For a counterexample, consider \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \u23a7 \u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23a9 1/\ud835\udc52 if \ud835\udc65 <\u22121, \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 if \u22121 \u2264\ud835\udc65 \u22641, \ud835\udc52 if \ud835\udc65 >1. See Figure 4.4.1 for the graph of \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65). Clearly, \ud835\udc54 is continuous on R and we have \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5b)(0) = \ud835\udc520 = 1 for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b. Thus the Taylor series for \ud835\udc54 is \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! , which 252 Chapter 4 Power Series converges on R. But recall that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208R. Hence \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) and \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! are not always equal, even though they are both defined and continuous throughout R. For instance, we have \ud835\udc54(2) = \ud835\udc52 \u0338= \ud835\udc522 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 2\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! . y=ex y=g x( ) Figure 4.4.1: Graphs of\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) For the remainder of this section, we will develop a method to determine if a Taylor series for a function \ud835\udc53 is equal to \ud835\udc53 on its interval of convergence. We first introduce a terminology for the partial sums of a Taylor series.

Example 4.4.6 For \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, we have \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b, and thus \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(0) = \ud835\udc520 = 1 for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b.

The next theorem enables us to bound the size of the error in this estimate. It was first proved by an Italian mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736\u20131813). Theorem 4.4.9 (Lagrange\u2019s Remainder Formula) Let \ud835\udc5a be a nonnegative integer. Suppose that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1) is continuous on an open interval \ud835\udc3c that contains \ud835\udc4e. If \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c, then there is a real number \ud835\udc50 between \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 (i.e., \ud835\udc50 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc65] if \ud835\udc65 \u2265\ud835\udc4e or \ud835\udc50 \u2208[\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc4e] if \ud835\udc65 < \ud835\udc4e) such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1)(\ud835\udc50) (\ud835\udc5a + 1)! (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1. (4.5) Proof: For simplicity, let us assume that \ud835\udc4e = 0 and \ud835\udc5a = 2. This simplification will not change the essence of the proof. Suppose now that 0 \u2208\ud835\udc3c and \ud835\udc53(3) is continuous on \ud835\udc3c. Since differentiability implies continuity, we deduce that \ud835\udc53, \ud835\udc53\u2032 and \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032 are all defined and continuous on \ud835\udc3c. We want to prove that for any \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c there is some \ud835\udc50 \u2208\ud835\udc3c between 0 and \ud835\udc65 such that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc472,0(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(3)(\ud835\udc50) 3! \ud835\udc653. (4.6) We recall that \ud835\udc472,0(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(0) + \ud835\udc53\u2032(0)\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(0) 2 \ud835\udc652. By Lemma 4.4.8, we have \ud835\udc472,0(0) = \ud835\udc53(0), \ud835\udc47\u2032 2,0(0) = \ud835\udc53\u2032(0), and \ud835\udc47\u2032\u2032 2,0(0) = \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(0). We also note that \ud835\udc47(3) 2,0 (\ud835\udc65) = 0 since \ud835\udc472,0(\ud835\udc65) is a polynomial in \ud835\udc65 with degree at most 2. There are three separate cases to consider. \u2022 \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e = 0: In this case, there is no choice but to choose \ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc4e = 0. Then (4.6) becomes \ud835\udc53(0) \u2212\ud835\udc472,0(0) = 0, which is certainly true. 256 Chapter 4 Power Series \u2022 \ud835\udc65 < \ud835\udc4e= 0: This case will be similar to the third case below and its proof will be omitted. \u2022 \ud835\udc65 > \ud835\udc4e= 0: For the rest of the proof, we will focus on this case. Note that (4.6) is equivalent to \ud835\udc53(3)(\ud835\udc50) = 6 \ud835\udc653 (\ufe00 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc472,0(\ud835\udc65) )\ufe00 (4.7) for some \ud835\udc50 \u2208[0, \ud835\udc65].

(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1 is negative or positive, respectively. When \ud835\udc5a = 0, Lagrange\u2019s Remainder Formula (4.5) reduces to \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc50)(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e) (4.8) for some \ud835\udc50 \u2208[\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc65] or for some \ud835\udc50 \u2208[\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc4e]. If \ud835\udc65 \u0338= \ud835\udc4e, then we can rewrite (4.8) as \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc50) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e , which is the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem when it is applied to the function \ud835\udc53 over the interval [\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc65] or [ \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc4e]. For comparison, the Mean Value Theorem places \ud835\udc50 in the smaller open interval (\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc65) or ( \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc4e), and hence is very slightly stronger than Lagrange\u2019s Remainder Formula. While Lagrange\u2019s Remainder Formula is powerful, we note that it does not tell us how to compute the specific \ud835\udc50. However, for most elementary applications, it will be enough to have some control over how large |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1)(\ud835\udc50)|can be. By taking the absolute values of both sides of (4.5), we immediately obtain the following useful corollary. Corollary 4.4.10 (Taylor\u2019s Inequality) Let \ud835\udc5a be a nonnegative integer. Suppose that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1) is continuous on an open interval \ud835\udc3c that contains \ud835\udc4e. If \u20d2\u20d2\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1)(\ud835\udc65) \u20d2\u20d2 \u2264\ud835\udc3e for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c, then we have |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc3e|\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|\ud835\udc5a+1 (\ud835\udc5a + 1)! for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c. REMARK When \ud835\udc5a = 1, recall that \ud835\udc471,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65). By Taylor\u2019s Inequality, if |\ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc3e for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c, then |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc3e|\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|2 2! = \ud835\udc3e 2 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)2 for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c. This is the upper bound on the error in the linear approximation that was discussed in MATH 137. 258 Chapter 4 Power Series Example 4.4.11 Let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652/3. Find the second degree Taylor polynomial for \ud835\udc53 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 8. If this Taylor polynomial is used to estimate \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) when \ud835\udc65 lies in the interval (5, 11), find an upper bound on the error. Solution: Since 8 = 23, we have \ud835\udc53(8) = 82/3 = (23) 2 3 = 22 = 4. We compute that \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 2 3\ud835\udc65\u22121/3 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc53\u2032(8) = 2 3 \u00b71 2 = 1 3 , \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u22122 9\ud835\udc65\u22124/3 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(8) = \u22122 9 \u00b7 1 24 = \u22121 72 . Hence we find that \ud835\udc472,8(\ud835\udc65) = 4 + 1 3(\ud835\udc65 \u22128) \u2212 1 144(\ud835\udc65",

If this Taylor polynomial is used to estimate \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) when \ud835\udc65 lies in the interval (5, 11), find an upper bound on the error. Solution: Since 8 = 23, we have \ud835\udc53(8) = 82/3 = (23) 2 3 = 22 = 4. We compute that \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = 2 3\ud835\udc65\u22121/3 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc53\u2032(8) = 2 3 \u00b71 2 = 1 3 , \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u22122 9\ud835\udc65\u22124/3 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(8) = \u22122 9 \u00b7 1 24 = \u22121 72 .

For an upper bound on the error, we will apply Taylor\u2019s Inequality with \ud835\udc5a = 2, \ud835\udc4e = 8 and \ud835\udc3c = (5, 11). We note that \ud835\udc53(3)(\ud835\udc65) = 8 27 \ud835\udc65\u22127/3, which is a strictly decreasing positive function on the interval (0 , \u221e). It follows that for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208(5, 11) \u2282(0, \u221e), we have |\ud835\udc53(3)(\ud835\udc65)|= \ud835\udc53(3)(\ud835\udc65) < \ud835\udc53(3)(5) = 8 27 \u00b75\u22127/3. Taylor\u2019s Inequality now gives |error |= |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc472,8(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 8 27 \u00b75\u22127/3 \u00b7|\ud835\udc65 \u22128|3 3! for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208(5, 11). Here, |\ud835\udc65 \u22128|is the distance between \ud835\udc65 and 8. If \ud835\udc65 \u2208(5, 11), then |\ud835\udc65 \u22128|< 3 and hence |\ud835\udc65 \u22128|3 < 33 = 27.

Now we are ready to state a sufficient condition for a function \ud835\udc53 to be equal to its Taylor series. Theorem 4.4.12 (Convergence Theorem for Taylor Series) Assume that \ud835\udc53 has derivatives of all orders on an open interval \ud835\udc3c that contains \ud835\udc4e. Further assume that there is a constant \ud835\udc3e such that \u20d2\u20d2\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc65) \u20d2\u20d2 \u2264\ud835\udc3e for every nonnegative integer \ud835\udc5b and for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c.

Use Taylor\u2019s Inequality get an upper bound on the error if 3 .5 < \ud835\udc65 <4.5. 260 Chapter 4 Power Series 4.4.2. The Taylor polynomial provides a decent approximation of ln(1 + \ud835\udc65) so long as \ud835\udc65 \u22480. Euler (1748) found a clever way to extend the domain of applicability. (a) Determine the first three non-zero terms in the Taylor polynomial of \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = ln (\ufe01 1+\ud835\udc65 1\u2212\ud835\udc65 )\ufe01 (|\ud835\udc65|< 1) by using the properties of logarithms to simplify the quotient. (b) Choose an appropriate value of \ud835\udc65 in your series from part (a) to find a fraction that approximates the value of ln 3. How does this compare with your calculator? 4.4.3. Find the Maclaurin series (i.e., the Taylor series centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0) for \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc653\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652 , and then use it to compute \ud835\udc53(63)(0) without actually taking sixty three derivatives. 4.4.4. Let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 + 1. Find the Taylor series for \ud835\udc53 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 and the Taylor series for \ud835\udc53 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 1. What are their intervals of convergence? 4.4.5. Show that if \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc65) is a polynomial whose degree is equal to \ud835\udc5a, then \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc65 + 1) = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc5b! . 4.4.6.

Cauchy derived Taylor\u2019s inequality via repeated integration-by-parts. Assuming that \ud835\udc65 > \ud835\udc4e(the other case proceeds similarly), Cauchy began with the surprising claim that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e) + \ud835\udc53(1)(\ud835\udc4e) (\ufe00 \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e )\ufe00 + \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e (\ufe00 \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc61 )\ufe00 \u00d7\ud835\udc53(2)(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 (4.11) (a) Prove Eq. 4.11 is true using integration-by-parts, differentiating (\ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc61) with respect to \ud835\udc61 and treating \ud835\udc65 as a constant. (b) Starting from Eq. 4.11, integrate-by-parts, but now integrating the (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc5b term at each step, to show that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e)",

Cauchy derived Taylor\u2019s inequality via repeated integration-by-parts. Assuming that \ud835\udc65 > \ud835\udc4e(the other case proceeds similarly), Cauchy began with the surprising claim that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc4e) + \ud835\udc53(1)(\ud835\udc4e) (\ufe00 \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e )\ufe00 + \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e (\ufe00 \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc61 )\ufe00 \u00d7\ud835\udc53(2)(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 (4.11) (a) Prove Eq. 4.11 is true using integration-by-parts, differentiating (\ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc61) with respect to \ud835\udc61 and treating \ud835\udc65 as a constant.

Section 4.5 Some Examples of Taylor Series 261 4.5 Some Examples of Taylor Series We start the section by reproving Theorem 4.3.6. Theorem 4.5.1 For all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R, we have \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! . Proof: Recall from Example 4.4.4 that \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! is the Taylor series for \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 (or the Maclaurin series for \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65). Consider an open interval \ud835\udc3c = ( \u2212\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc35), where \ud835\udc35 > 0 is a strictly positive real number. If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65, then \u20d2\u20d2\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc65) \u20d2\u20d2 = |\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65|= \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 < \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc35 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u2212\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc35). (Note that \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 is a strictly increasing function.) Therefore, by the Convergence Theorem for Taylor Series (Theorem 4.4.12), we have the equality \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208 (\u2212\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc35). Given an arbitrary \ud835\udc65 \u2208R, \ud835\udc65 is contained in \ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc35) for some large enough \ud835\udc35 >0. Hence \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b! holds for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R. Theorem 4.5.2 For all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R, we have cos \ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc5b (2\ud835\udc5b)! = 1 \u2212\ud835\udc652 2! + \ud835\udc654 4! \u2212\ud835\udc656 6! + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 , (4.12) sin \ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc5b+1 (2\ud835\udc5b + 1)! = \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc653 3! + \ud835\udc655 5! \u2212\ud835\udc657 7! + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . (4.13) Proof: Both cos \ud835\udc65 and sin \ud835\udc65 are infinitely differentiable on \ud835\udc3c = R, and their \ud835\udc5b-th derivatives (namely, \u00b1cos \ud835\udc65 or \u00b1sin \ud835\udc65) are all bounded above by \ud835\udc3e = 1. By the Convergence Theorem for Taylor Series (Theorem 4.4.12), we conclude that cos \ud835\udc65 and sin \ud835\udc65 are equal to their respective Taylor series centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 (or their respective Maclaurin series). It only remains to determine the coefficents of the Taylor series for cos \ud835\udc65 and sin \ud835\udc65 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0. Let us start with cos \ud835\udc65. \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = cos \ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc53(0) = 1, \ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u2212sin \ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc53\u2032(0) = 0, \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u2212cos \ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc53\u2032\u2032(0) = \u22121, \ud835\udc53(3)(\ud835\udc65) = sin \ud835\udc65 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc53(3)(0) =",

REMARK The first few Taylor polynomials for cos \ud835\udc65 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 are: \ud835\udc470,0(\ud835\udc65) = 1 , \ud835\udc471,0(\ud835\udc65) = 1 , \ud835\udc472,0(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \u2212\ud835\udc652 2! , \ud835\udc473,0(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \u2212\ud835\udc652 2! , \ud835\udc474,0(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \u2212\ud835\udc652 2! + \ud835\udc654 4! . See Figure 4.5.5 below for a sketch of their graphs. Since the odd order derivatives of cos \ud835\udc65 are zero at \ud835\udc65 = 0, the Taylor series and the Taylor polynomials for cos \ud835\udc65 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 contain only even powers of \ud835\udc65. (Similarly, the Taylor series and the Taylor polynomials for sin \ud835\udc65 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 contain only odd powers of \ud835\udc65.) It follows that the Taylor polynomials for cos \ud835\udc65 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 satisfy \ud835\udc472\ud835\udc58,0(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc472\ud835\udc58+1,0(\ud835\udc65) for every nonnegative integer\ud835\udc58. Thus the actual degree of an \ud835\udc5a-th degree Taylor polynomial can be strictly less than \ud835\udc5a. Example 4.5.3 Find the Taylor series for \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 3.

We note that the numerator of (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 has \ud835\udc5b factors. We also define (\ufe02\ud835\udefc 0 )\ufe02 = 1, and (\ufe02 \ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 = 0 by convention. Example 4.6.2 (\ufe024 2 )\ufe02 = 4 \u00b73 2! = 12 2 = 6, (\ufe024 0 )\ufe02 = 1, (\ufe02 4 \u22122 )\ufe02 = 0, and (\ufe021 2 3 )\ufe02 = 1 2 (\ufe00 \u22121 2 )\ufe00(\ufe00 \u22123 2 )\ufe00 3 \u00b72 \u00b71 = 3 8 6 = 3 48.

REMARK If \ud835\udc58 is a positive integer, then we have the identity (\ufe02\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 = \ud835\udc58! \ud835\udc5b!(\ud835\udc58 \u2212\ud835\udc5b)!. The last quotient is equal to the number of different ways we can choose \ud835\udc5b things from a collection of \ud835\udc58 of them. Motivated by this, we will usually read aloud the symbol (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 as \u201c\ud835\udefc choose \ud835\udc5b\u201d.

(4.14) Consequently, the symbols (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 are also commonly called \u201cbinomial coefficients\u201d. Section 4.6 Binomial Series 267 Next we state a technical lemma which will be useful later. Lemma 4.6.4 Let \ud835\udefc be a real number and let \ud835\udc5b be a strictly positive integer. Then (\ufe02 \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b + 1 )\ufe02 (\ud835\udc5b + 1) + (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udc5b = (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udefc. Proof: First we note that (\ufe02 \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b + 1 )\ufe02 (\ud835\udc5b + 1) = \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udefc \u22121) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(\ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b + 1)(\ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b) (\ud835\udc5b + 1)! (\ud835\udc5b + 1) = \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udefc \u22121) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(\ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b + 1) \ud835\udc5b!

Therefore, we have (\ufe02 \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b + 1 )\ufe02 (\ud835\udc5b + 1) + (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udc5b = (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 (\ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b) + (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udc5b = (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 (\ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc5b) = (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udefc.

Then \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udefc \u22121) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (\ufe00 \ud835\udefc \u2212(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) )\ufe00 (1 + \ud835\udc65)\ud835\udefc\u2212\ud835\udc5b, and hence \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(0) = \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udefc \u22121) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (\ufe00 \ud835\udefc \u2212(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) )\ufe00 . It follows that the Taylor series for \ud835\udc53 centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 (or the Maclaurin series for \ud835\udc53) is equal to \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b)(0) \ud835\udc5b! \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udefc \u22121) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (\ufe00 \ud835\udefc \u2212(\ud835\udc5b \u22121) )\ufe00 \ud835\udc5b! \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b. Since our Taylor series is centred at\ud835\udc65 = 0, its interval of convergence automatically contains \ud835\udc65 = 0. When \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 0, every term in our Taylor series is nonzero because (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \u0338= 0 as observed earlier. Thus we can apply the Ratio Test (Theorem 3.7.1 with \ud835\udc58 = 1) when \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 0. We compute that \ud835\udc3f = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 (\ufe00 \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b+1 )\ufe00 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1 (\ufe00\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe00 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udefc\u22121)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(\ud835\udefc\u2212\ud835\udc5b) (\ud835\udc5b+1)! \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udefc\u22121)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(\ud835\udefc\u2212(\ud835\udc5b\u22121)) \ud835\udc5b! \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 (\ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b + 1 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e |\ud835\udc65|\u00b7 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b + 1 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = |\ud835\udc65|\u00b7 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udefc \u2212\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b + 1 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = |\ud835\udc65|\u00b7|\u2212 1|= |\ud835\udc65|.

We claim that (1 + \ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) (4.17) Section 4.6 Binomial Series 269 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u22121, 1). If our claim is true, then we have \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 (\ufe02 \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) (1 + \ud835\udc65)\ud835\udefc )\ufe02 = (1 + \ud835\udc65)\ud835\udefc\u22121 (1 + \ud835\udc65)2\ud835\udefc \u00b70 = 0 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u22121, 1). Hence there is a constant \ud835\udc36 such that \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) (1 + \ud835\udc65)\ud835\udefc = \ud835\udc36 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u22121, 1). By plugging in \ud835\udc65 = 0 (which lies in the interval ( \u22121, 1)) into the last equation, we find that \ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc54(0) (1 + 0)\ud835\udefc = (\ufe00\ud835\udefc 0 )\ufe00 1\ud835\udefc = 1 1 = 1. Thus we obtain (4.16), and we will be done with our proof. Therefore, it only remains to prove our claim (4.17). Termwise differentiation yields \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=1 (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121 (4.18) for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u22121, 1). If we change the index variable by setting \u2113 = \ud835\udc5b \u22121, i.e., \ud835\udc5b = \u2113 + 1, then \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \u2113=0 (\ufe02 \ud835\udefc \u2113 + 1 )\ufe02 (\u2113 + 1)\ud835\udc65\u2113. By renaming the index variable \u2113 back to \ud835\udc5b, we obtain \ud835\udc54\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\ufe02 \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b + 1 )\ufe02 (\ud835\udc5b + 1)\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b (4.19) for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u22121, 1).

This proves claim (4.17), and we are finished with our proof. 270 Chapter 4 Power Series REMARK Let Z\u22650 denote the set of nonnegative integers. Let \ud835\udc3c denote the interval of convergence for the power series \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\ufe02\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5b )\ufe02 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b.

(a) Show, using facts about circles and triangles, that the shaded area is \ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udf0b 24 \u2212 \u221a 3 32 . (b) Express the shaded area as an integral. Use the first three terms of the Taylor series expansion of (1 \u2212\ud835\udc65)1/2 about \ud835\udc4e = 0, \ud835\udc472,0(\ud835\udc65), to estimate the value of the integral. (c) Combine parts (a) and (b) to estimate the value of \ud835\udf0b. 4.6.5. Newton combined the binomial expansion with rules for integrating polynomials to solve a dazzling array of problems. Often, he was unable to use the binomial expansion directly, but had to invert one series to find another. (a) For example, beginning with the series, \ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc653 \u2212\ud835\udc654 + . . . , (4.22) Newton sought a series of \ud835\udc65 in terms of \ud835\udc67. He proceeded in the following way: throw away all the higher-powers of x. That leaves, \ud835\udc67 \u2248\ud835\udc65. But there will be some error in that approximation, so set \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc5d. Substituting into the original series, Eq. 4.22, gives [\ufe00 (\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc5d) \u2212(\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc5d)2 + (\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc5d)3 \u2212(\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc5d)4 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ]\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udc67 = 0. Expanding and re-arranging gives, [\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udc672 + \ud835\udc673 \u2212\ud835\udc674 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ]\ufe00 + [\ufe00 1 \u22122\ud835\udc67 + 3\ud835\udc672 \u22124\ud835\udc673 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ]\ufe00 \ud835\udc5d + [\ufe00 \u22121 + 3\ud835\udc67 \u22126\ud835\udc672 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ]\ufe00 \ud835\udc5d2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = 0. Now, throw away all higher-powers of \ud835\udc5d, and solve, \ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc672 \u2212\ud835\udc673 + \ud835\udc674 \u2212\ud835\udc675 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 1 \u22122\ud835\udc67 + 3\ud835\udc672 \u22124\ud835\udc673 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. Finally, throw away all higher-powers of \ud835\udc67 in the numerator and denominator to get, \ud835\udc5d \u2248\ud835\udc672 1 = \ud835\udc672. So, \ud835\udc65 \u2248\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc672. But not exactly; set \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc672 + \ud835\udc5e and substitute in the original series, Eq. 4.22, and proceed as above to generate more terms, \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc672 + \ud835\udc673 + \ud835\udc674 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . (4.23) At each step, Newton throws away most terms, so how can he be sure he\u2019s on the right track? For |\ud835\udc65|< 1 and |\ud835\udc67|< 1, both series (Eqs. 4.22 and 4.23) converge. Find what they converge to and show that Eq. 4.23 is indeed the inverse of the original series, Eq. 4.22. (b) Find the four-term Maclaurin series for \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = arcsin \ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ufe00\ud835\udc65 0 1\u221a 1\u2212\ud835\udc612 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61.

Finally, we will illustrate how to compute certain indefinite integrals using Taylor series. We will also estimate certain definite integrals using Taylor series. Example 4.7.6 Express the indefinite integral \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 as a power series.

Termwise integration gives \u222b\ufe01 \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc36 + \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc5b!(2\ud835\udc5b + 1) .

How many terms of this alternating series would we need to add to estimate \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 with an error that is at most 1 10!(21)? Solution: From (4.24) and statement (iv) of Theorem 4.3.1 (with \ud835\udc4f = 0, \ud835\udc51 = 1, \ud835\udc4e = 0 and 278 Chapter 4 Power Series \ud835\udc45 = \u221e), we deduce that \u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b!

From the Alternating Series Test (Theorem 3.5.4 with \ud835\udc58 = 1), we deduce that our alternating series converges. Let \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b!(2\ud835\udc5b + 1) denote the \ud835\udc5a-th partial sum. From the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem (Theorem 3.5.7), we deduce that |error |= \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 (\ufe02\u222b\ufe01 1 0 \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 )\ufe02 \u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u2264 1 (\ud835\udc5a + 1)! (\ufe00 2(\ud835\udc5a + 1) + 1 )\ufe00. It follows that our error will be at most 1 10!(21) when \ud835\udc5a = 9.

Following Euler, show that the function \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) in part (a) can be written as an infinite product, \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = (\ufe02 1 \u2212\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udf0b2 )\ufe02(\ufe02 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc652 4\ud835\udf0b2 )\ufe02(\ufe02 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc652 9\ud835\udf0b2 )\ufe02 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (\ufe02 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udf0b2 )\ufe02 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 280 Chapter 4 Power Series (c) Euler reasoned that if the infinite sum and the infinite product represent the same function, then when expanded as a polynomial their coefficients should agree. Equate the coefficient of \ud835\udc652 in the sum from part (a) to the coefficient of \ud835\udc652 ob- tained by multiplying out the infinite product in part (b). What do you conclude? 4.7.5. In astrophysics, the Lane\u2013Emden equation (1870) characterizes the gravitational po- tential of a Newtonian star, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\u2032\u2032(\ud835\udc65) + 2\ud835\udc66\u2032(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) = 0, \ud835\udc66 (0) = 1, \ud835\udc66\u2032(0) = 0. Suppose that the solution can be represented as a power-series with a non-zero radius of convergence, \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b (a) Use the differential equation and initial conditions to determine the coefficients \ud835\udc500, \ud835\udc501, \ud835\udc502, \ud835\udc503, and \ud835\udc504. Use these to write down the 4 \ud835\udc61\u210e-degree Taylor polynomial \ud835\udc470,4(\ud835\udc65) that approximates the solution \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65). (b) The pattern of the coefficients should be familiar. Write down the solution in closed-form by recognizing the function your series represents. What is the smallest positive value of \ud835\udc65 where \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65) = 0? Section 4.8 Big-O Notation 281 4.8 Big-O Notation In this last section, we introduce a notation that is widely used in many fields. Definition 4.8.1 Big-O Notation Let \ud835\udc4e denote a real number or \u221e. Assume that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) are two functions that are defined for all real \ud835\udc65 values that are near \ud835\udc4e but are not necessarily defined when \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. More precisely, if \ud835\udc4e \u2208R, we assume that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) are both defined for all \ud835\udc65 in the union \ud835\udc3c = (\ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udeff, \ud835\udc4e) \u222a(\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udeff) = {\ud835\udc65 \u2208R |0 < |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|< \ud835\udeff}, where \ud835\udeff is some strictly positive real number. If \ud835\udc4e = \u221e, we assume that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) are both defined for all \ud835\udc65 in some open interval \ud835\udc3c = (\ud835\udc50, \u221e), where \ud835\udc50 \u2208R. We write \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e (4.25) if there exists a real constant \ud835\udc40 >0 such that |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)| (4.26) for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c. REMARK Equation (4.25) is read as \u201c\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) is big-O of \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) as \ud835\udc65 goes to \ud835\udc4e\u201d. This notation is sometimes referred to as a Landau",

We write \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e (4.25) if there exists a real constant \ud835\udc40 >0 such that |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)| (4.26) for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c. REMARK Equation (4.25) is read as \u201c\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) is big-O of \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) as \ud835\udc65 goes to \ud835\udc4e\u201d. This notation is sometimes referred to as a Landau notation in honour of the German mathematician Edmund Landau (1877\u20131938) who popularized the notation. The \u201cO\u201d stands for the German word Ordnung, which means order. We should interpret the symbol \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) as a generic name for any function \ud835\udc53 that satisfies inequality (4.26) for all \ud835\udc65 near \ud835\udc4e. Example 4.8.2 As long as \ud835\udc53 is defined for all real \ud835\udc65 values that are near \ud835\udc4e, we have \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e. Note that we can just choose \ud835\udc40 = 1 and (4.26) becomes |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264| \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|, which is certainly true whenever \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) is defined. Example 4.8.3 Note that |sin \ud835\udc65|\u2264 1 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R. Thus we can write that sin \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc42(1) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\u221e. Here, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = 1 is a constant function, and we can choose \ud835\udc40 = 1 and \ud835\udc50 to be any real number. More generally, if \ud835\udc53 is a bounded function defined on an open interval (\ud835\udc50, \u221e), then we have \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(1) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\u221e. 282 Chapter 4 Power Series Example 4.8.4 If \ud835\udc65 \u2208(1, \u221e), i.e. \ud835\udc65 >1, then |\ud835\udc65|= \ud835\udc65 >1 (since \ud835\udc65 is strictly positive) and hence |\ud835\udc65|= |\ud835\udc65|\u00b71 < |\ud835\udc65|\u00b7|\ud835\udc65|= |\ud835\udc65|2 = |\ud835\udc652|. Therefore, we can conclude that \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc652) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\u221e. (We can choose \ud835\udc3c = (1, \u221e) and \ud835\udc40 = 1.) On the other hand, we can prove that \ud835\udc652 \u0338= \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\u221e. Given any real constant \ud835\udc40 >0, if \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\ud835\udc40, \u221e), i.e. \ud835\udc65 > \ud835\udc40, then |\ud835\udc65|= \ud835\udc65 > \ud835\udc40 and hence |\ud835\udc652|= |\ud835\udc65|2 = |\ud835\udc65|\u00b7|\ud835\udc65|> \ud835\udc40\u00b7|\ud835\udc65| for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\ud835\udc40, \u221e). Therefore, it would be impossible to have |\ud835\udc652|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc65| for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\ud835\udc50, \u221e) for some \ud835\udc50 \u2208R. The intervals ( \ud835\udc40, \u221e) and ( \ud835\udc50, \u221e) will always have nonempty intersection. (In fact, ( \ud835\udc40, \u221e) \u2229(\ud835\udc50, \u221e) = (\ud835\udc51, \u221e), where \ud835\udc51 = max{\ud835\udc40, \ud835\udc50}.) The choice of the limiting value \ud835\udc4e matters in the big-O notation as the following example shows when compared with the previous example. Example 4.8.5 As \ud835\udc65 \u21920, prove that \ud835\udc652 = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65), but \ud835\udc65 \u0338= \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc652). Solution: To prove that \ud835\udc652 = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65) as \ud835\udc65 \u21920, we must find constants \ud835\udeff >0 and \ud835\udc40 > 0 such that |\ud835\udc652|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc65| (4.27) for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff). Now let \ud835\udeff >0 be arbitrary. If \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff), then we have |\ud835\udc65|< \ud835\udeff.",

Solution: To prove that \ud835\udc652 = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65) as \ud835\udc65 \u21920, we must find constants \ud835\udeff >0 and \ud835\udc40 > 0 such that |\ud835\udc652|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc65| (4.27) for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff). Now let \ud835\udeff >0 be arbitrary. If \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff), then we have |\ud835\udc65|< \ud835\udeff. (4.28) If \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff), then we also have |\ud835\udc65|> 0. By multiplying |\ud835\udc65|to both sides of (4.28), we obtain |\ud835\udc65|2 < \ud835\udeff|\ud835\udc65|. Thus we can just choose \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udeff and then the last inequality implies (4.27). To prove that \ud835\udc65 \u0338= \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc652) as \ud835\udc65 \u21920, we argue by contradiction. Suppose we had \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc652). Then there exist constants \ud835\udeff >0 and \ud835\udc40 >0 such that |\ud835\udc65|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc652|= \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc65|2 for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff). Since \ud835\udc65 \u0338= 0 when \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c, we can divide both sides of the last inequality by |\ud835\udc65|2 (which is strictly positive) and obtain 1 |\ud835\udc65|\u2264\ud835\udc40 (4.29) Section 4.8 Big-O Notation 283 for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c = ( \u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff). Now note that lim \ud835\udc65\u21920 1 |\ud835\udc65|= \u221e, and hence 1 |\ud835\udc65| takes on arbitrarily large values inside \ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff). But this contradicts (4.29). For a large enough positive integer \ud835\udc41 >1, we will have \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc40 + \ud835\udc40 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \ud835\udc40\u23df \u23de \ud835\udc41 summands > 1 \ud835\udeff , and hence 0 < 1 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc40 < \ud835\udeff. Then \ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc40 lies in \ud835\udc3c, but 1 |\ud835\udc65|= 1 \ud835\udc65 = 1 1 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc40 > \ud835\udc40, which violates (4.29). REMARK Let \ud835\udc5a and \ud835\udc5b be nonnegative integers. As \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0, we can argue as in the solution to the previous example and show that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) if and only if \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc5b. In other words, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) as \ud835\udc65 \u21920 if and only if \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b divides \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a. Next we state a couple of general theorems that are useful. The first one is the following transitivity result. Theorem 4.8.6 Let \ud835\udc4e denote a real number or \u221e. If \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\u210e(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e, then \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\u210e(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e. Proof: Since \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e, there exist a set \ud835\udc3c1 and a constant \ud835\udc401 > 0 such that |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)| (4.30) for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c1. Here, \ud835\udc3c1 = (\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udeff1, \ud835\udc4e)\u222a(\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e+\ud835\udeff1) for some \ud835\udeff1 > 0 if \ud835\udc4e \u2208R, and \ud835\udc3c = (\ud835\udc501, \u221e) for some \ud835\udc501 \u2208R if \ud835\udc4e = \u221e. Similarly, since \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\u210e(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e, there exist a set \ud835\udc3c2 and a constant \ud835\udc402 > 0 such that |\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc402|\u210e(\ud835\udc65)| (4.31) for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c2.

If \ud835\udc4e = \u221e, then \ud835\udc3c1 \u2229\ud835\udc3c2 = (\ud835\udc50, \u221e), where \ud835\udc50 = max{\ud835\udc501, \ud835\udc502}. In summary, we have |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\u210e(\ud835\udc65)| for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c, where \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc401\ud835\udc402 and \ud835\udc3c = \ud835\udc3c1 \u2229\ud835\udc3c2. 284 Chapter 4 Power Series Theorem 4.8.7 Let \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f be real numbers or \u221e. Assume that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65)) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e, and lim \ud835\udc65\u2192\ud835\udc4f \u210e(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc4e. If \ud835\udc4e is a real number, further assume that \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u0338= \ud835\udc4e for every \ud835\udc65 sufficiently close to \ud835\udc4f. (More precisely, if \ud835\udc4f \u2208R, assume that \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u0338= \ud835\udc4e for every \ud835\udc65 satisfying 0 < |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4f|< \ud835\udeff for some constant \ud835\udeff > 0. If \ud835\udc4f = \u221e, assume that \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u0338= \ud835\udc4e for every \ud835\udc65 satisfying \ud835\udc65 > \ud835\udc50for some constant \ud835\udc50 \u2208R.) Then \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc65)) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4f. Proof: We only consider the case when \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f are both real numbers. The proofs for the other three cases are similar and are omitted. Since \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc66) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc66)) as \ud835\udc66 \u2192\ud835\udc4e, there are strictly positive constants \ud835\udc40 and \ud835\udf16 such that |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc66)|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc66)| (4.32) for every \ud835\udc66 satisfying 0 < |\ud835\udc66\u2212\ud835\udc4e|< \ud835\udf16. Since lim \ud835\udc65\u2192\ud835\udc4f \u210e(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc4e, there is a strictly positive constant \ud835\udeff1 such that |\u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc4e|< \ud835\udf16 for every \ud835\udc65 satisfying 0 < |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4f|< \ud835\udeff1. Now let \ud835\udeff2 = min{\ud835\udeff, \ud835\udeff1}, where \ud835\udeff is the strictly positive constant in the hypothesis of our theorem. If 0 < |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4f|< \ud835\udeff2 holds, then we must have |\u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc4e|< \ud835\udf16and \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u0338= \ud835\udc4e. Thus we have 0 < |\u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc4e|< \ud835\udf16 for every \ud835\udc65 satisfying 0 < |\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4f|< \ud835\udeff2. Setting \ud835\udc66 = \u210e(\ud835\udc65) in (4.32), we obtain |\ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc54(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))| for every \ud835\udc65 satisfying 0 < |\ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc4f|< \ud835\udeff2. By setting \ud835\udc3c = (\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udeff2, \ud835\udc4e)\u222a(\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e+\ud835\udeff2) in the definition of the big-O notation, we conclude that \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc65)) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc54(\u210e(\ud835\udc65))) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4f. For the rest of the section, we will focus on big-O symbols when \ud835\udc65 \u21920.

The following theorem tells us how to perform certain algebraic operations with big-O symbols when \ud835\udc65 \u21920. Theorem 4.8.8 Let \ud835\udc5a and \ud835\udc5b be nonnegative integers. As \ud835\udc65 \u21920, the following statements hold. (i) \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a) \u00b7\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a+\ud835\udc5b).

(iii) \ud835\udc65 \u00b7\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1). (iv) 1 \ud835\udc65 \u00b7\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121) when \ud835\udc5b \u22651. (v) \ud835\udc36 \u00b7\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) for any real constant \ud835\udc36. (vi) lim \ud835\udc65\u21920 \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) = 0 when \ud835\udc5b \u22651. Proof: Let \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) and \u210e(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a) as \ud835\udc65 \u21920. Then there exist strictly positive constants \ud835\udeff1, \ud835\udeff2, \ud835\udc401 and \ud835\udc402 such that |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b| (4.33) Section 4.8 Big-O Notation 285 for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u2212\ud835\udeff1, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff1), and |\u210e(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc402|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a| (4.34) for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208 (\u2212\ud835\udeff2, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff2). Now let \ud835\udeff = min {\ud835\udeff1, \ud835\udeff2}and let \ud835\udc3c = ( \u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff). Multiplying (4.33) and (4.34) together, we obtain |\u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u00b7\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|= |\u210e(\ud835\udc65)|\u00b7|\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc402\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a|\u00b7|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b|= \ud835\udc402\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a+\ud835\udc5b| for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c. By setting \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc402\ud835\udc401 in the definition of the big-O notation, we can conclude that \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u00b7\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a+\ud835\udc5b) as \ud835\udc65 \u21920, which proves statement (i). Next we prove statement (ii). Without loss of generality, we may assume that \ud835\udc5a \u2265\ud835\udc5b. Then we have \ud835\udc58 = min {\ud835\udc5a, \ud835\udc5b}= \ud835\udc5b. Since \ud835\udc5a \u2212\ud835\udc5b \u22650, we also have |\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\u2212\ud835\udc5b|< \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5a\u2212\ud835\udc5b for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c = (\u2212\ud835\udeff, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff). Using the triangle inequality, we obtain |\u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u00b1\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264| \u210e(\ud835\udc65)|+ |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc402|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a|+ \ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b|= (\ud835\udc402|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\u2212\ud835\udc5b|+ \ud835\udc401)|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b| < (\ud835\udc402\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5a\u2212\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc401)|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b| for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c. By setting \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc402\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5a\u2212\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc401 in the definition of the big-O notation, we can conclude that \u210e(\ud835\udc65) \u00b1\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58) as \ud835\udc65 \u21920, which proves statement (ii). By multiplying (4.33) by \ud835\udc65, 1 \ud835\udc65 or \ud835\udc36, we obtain |\ud835\udc65 \u00b7\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|= |\ud835\udc65|\u00b7|\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264| \ud835\udc65|\u00b7\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b|= \ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1|, \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 1 \ud835\udc65 \u00b7\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 = \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 1 \ud835\udc65 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u00b7|\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 1 \ud835\udc65 \u20d2\u20d2\u20d2\u20d2 \u00b7\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b|= \ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121|, |\ud835\udc36 \u00b7\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|= |\ud835\udc36|\u00b7|\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264| \ud835\udc36|\u00b7\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b|= |\ud835\udc36|\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b| for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u2212\ud835\udeff1, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff1).

Thus we have proved statement (v). 286 Chapter 4 Power Series Finally, we note that (4.33) is equivalent to \u2212\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b|\u2264 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2264\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b| for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208(\u2212\ud835\udeff1, 0) \u222a(0, \ud835\udeff1). Since lim \ud835\udc65\u21920 (\u00b1\ud835\udc401|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b|) = 0, the Squeeze Theorem implies that lim \ud835\udc65\u21920 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 0 as well. Thus we have proved statement (vi). The big-O notation can be used to state the following version of Taylor\u2019s Inequality. Theorem 4.8.9 (Taylor\u2019s Inequality, the Big-O Version) Let \ud835\udc5a be a nonnegative integer. Suppose that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1) is continuous on an open interval \ud835\udc3c that contains \ud835\udc4e \u2208R. If there is a real constant \ud835\udc3e >0 such that \u20d2\u20d2\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1)(\ud835\udc65) \u20d2\u20d2 \u2264\ud835\udc3e for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c, then we have \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1)\ufe00 (4.35) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e. Moreover, if \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to \ud835\udc5a with the property that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc42 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1)\ufe00 (4.36) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e, then \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65). Proof: Recall that the Taylor\u2019s Inequality states that |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc3e|\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|\ud835\udc5a+1 (\ud835\udc5a + 1)! for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c. Setting \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc3e (\ud835\udc5a + 1)! , we obtain |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65)|\u2264 \ud835\udc40|\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e|\ud835\udc5a+1 = \ud835\udc40|(\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1| for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208\ud835\udc3c. Now any open interval \ud835\udc3c containing \ud835\udc4e will also contain the union (\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udeff, \ud835\udc4e)\u222a (\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udeff) for all small enough \ud835\udeff >0. Hence we have proved (4.35) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e. Next suppose that \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) satisfies (4.36) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e. We will be done if we can show that \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) = 0 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208R. First we observe that \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to \ud835\udc5a since both \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) are. By statement (ii) of Theorem 4.8.8, we deduce that \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) \u2212 (\ufe00 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \u2212\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65) )\ufe00 = \ud835\udc42 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1)\ufe00 \u2212\ud835\udc42 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1)\ufe00 = \ud835\udc42 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1)\ufe00 as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e. Now we claim that the only polynomial of degree less than or equal to \ud835\udc5a that is \ud835\udc42 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1)\ufe00 as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e is the constant zero polynomial.

The proof of this claim is a bit technical and is left as an exercise (cf. Problem 4.8.6). Section 4.8 Big-O Notation 287 REMARK Sometimes it is useful to rewrite (4.35) as \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc42 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1)\ufe00 (4.37) as \ud835\udc65 \u2192\ud835\udc4e. Both (4.35) and (4.37) state that the error in the estimate given by the Taylor polynomial is big-O of ( \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1. The big-O version of Taylor\u2019s Inequality also tells us that the Taylor polynomial \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc65) is the only polynomial that gives an \ud835\udc42 (\ufe00 (\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc5a+1)\ufe00 estimate of \ud835\udc53 near \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e. The hypothesis of Theorem 4.8.9 is automatically satisfied if we already know that the Taylor series for \ud835\udc53 centred at \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e converges to \ud835\udc53 on an open interval \ud835\udc3d. In that case, we can just choose a closed subinterval [ \ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udeff, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udeff] \u2282\ud835\udc3d for some small enough \ud835\udeff >0, and let \ud835\udc3e = max {\ufe00 |\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1)(\ud835\udc65)| \u20d2\u20d2 \ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udeff \u2264\ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udeff }\ufe00 and \ud835\udc3c = (\ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udeff, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udeff) for the hypothesis of Theorem 4.8.9 to be satisfied. Note that \ud835\udc53 is differentiable up to any order on \ud835\udc3d by statement (i) of Theorem 4.3.1. It follows that \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+2) = (\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1))\u2032is defined on \ud835\udc3d and thus \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5a+1) is differentiable and hence continuous on \ud835\udc3d and on the subinterval [ \ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udeff, \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udeff]. The existence of our \ud835\udc3e now follows from the Extreme Value Theorem in MATH 137. Example 4.8.10 Prove that arctan(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc653 3 + \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc655) as \ud835\udc65 \u21920. Solution: Recall from equation (4.4) in Section 4.3 that arctan(\ud835\udc65) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b 2\ud835\udc5b + 1\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc5b+1 when |\ud835\udc65| < 1. By the uniqueness of power series representation (Theorem 4.4.2), this must be the Taylor series for arctan( \ud835\udc65) centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0. Thus the fourth degree Taylor polynomial for arctan(\ud835\udc65) centred at \ud835\udc65 = 0 must be \ud835\udc474,0(\ud835\udc65) = 1\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b 2\ud835\udc5b + 1\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc5b+1 = \ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc653 3 .
