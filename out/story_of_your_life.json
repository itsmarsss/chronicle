Your dad and I have just come back \ueecaom an evening out, dinner and a show; it\u2019s a\ueecber midnight. We came out onto the patio to look at the full moon; then I told your dad I wanted to dance, so he humors me and now we\u2019re slow-dancing, a pair of thirtysomethings swaying back and forth in the moon-light like kids. I don\u2019t feel the night chill at all. And then your dad says, \u201cDo you want to make a baby?\u201d Right now your dad and I have been married for about two years, living on Ellis Avenue; when we move out you\u2019ll still be too young to remember the house, but we\u2019ll show you pictures of it, tell you stories about it. I\u2019d love to tell you the story of this evening, the night you\u2019re conceived, but the right time to do that would be when you\u2019re ready to have children of your own, and we\u2019ll never get that chance. T elling it to you any earlier wouldn\u2019t do any good; for most of your life you won\u2019t sit still to hear such a romantic\u2014 you\u2019d say sappy\u2014story. I remember the scenario of your origin you\u2019ll suggest when you\u2019re twelve. \u201cThe only reason you had me was so you could get a maid you wouldn\u2019t have to pay,\u201d you\u2019ll say bitterly, dragging the vacuum cleaner out of the closet. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I\u2019ll say. \u201cThirteen years ago I knew the carpets would need vacu- uming around now, and having a baby seemed to be the cheapest and easiest way to get the job done. Now kindly get on with it.\u201d \u201cIf you weren\u2019t my mother, this would be illegal,\u201d you\u2019ll say, seething as you unwind the power cord and plug it into the wall outlet. That will be in the house on Belmont Street. I\u2019ll live to see strangers occupy both houses: the one you\u2019re conceived in and the one you grow up in. Your dad and I will sell the \ufb01rst a couple years a\ueecber your arrival. I\u2019ll sell the second shortly a\ueecber your departure. By then Nelson and I will have moved into our farmhouse, and your dad will be living with what\u2019s-her-name. 2 I know how this story ends; I think about it a lot.

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us,\u201d he said. \u201cNot at all; any excuse to avoid the faculty meeting.\u201d Colonel Weber indicated his companion. \u201cThis is Dr. Gary Donnelly, the physicist I mentioned when we spoke on the phone.\u201d \u201cCall me Gary,\u201d he said as we shook hands. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to hear what you have to say.\u201d We entered my o\ufb03ce. I moved a couple of stacks of books o\ufb00 the second guest chair, and we all sat down. \u201cYou said you wanted me to listen to a recording.

The recording sounded vaguely like that of a wet dog shaking the water out of its fur. \u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d he asked. I withheld my comparison to a wet dog. \u201cWhat was the context in which this recording was made?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to say.\u201d \u201cIt would help me interpret those sounds.

They\u2019re almost certainly using sounds that the human vocal tract can\u2019t reproduce, and maybe sounds that the human ear can\u2019t distinguish.\u201d \u201cYou mean in\ueecaa- or ultrasonic \ueecaequencies?\u201d asked Gary Donnelly. \u201cNot speci\ufb01cally. I just mean that the human auditory system isn\u2019t an absolute acoustic instrument; It\u2019s optimized to recognize the sounds that a human larynx makes. With an alien vocal system, all bets are o\ufb00.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll be able to hear the di\ufb00erence between alien phonemes, given enough practice, but it\u2019s possible our ears simply can\u2019t recognize the distinctions they consider meaningful. In that case we\u2019d need a sound spectrograph to know what an alien is saying.\u201d Colonel Weber asked, \u201cSuppose I gave you an hour\u2019s worth of recordings; how long would it take you to determine if we need this sound spectrograph or not?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t determine that with just a recording no matter how much time I had. I\u2019d need to talk with the aliens directly.\u201d The colonel shook his head. \u201cNot possible.\u201d I tried to break it to him gently. \u201cThat\u2019s your call, of course. But the only way to learn an unknown language is to interact with a native speaker, and by that I mean asking questions, holding a conversation, that sort of thing. Without that, it\u2019s simply not possible. So if you want to learn the aliens\u2019 language, someone with training in \ufb01eld linguistics\u2014 whether it\u2019s me or someone else\u2014will have to talk with an alien. Recordings alone aren\u2019t su\ufb03cient.\u201d Colonel Weber \ueecaowned. \u201cYou seem to be implying that no alien could have learned human languages by monitoring our broadcasts.\u201d \u201cI doubt it. They\u2019d need instructional material speci\ufb01cally designed to teach human languages to non-humans. Either that, or interaction with a human. If they had either of those, they could learn a lot \ueecaom TV, but otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have a starting point.\u201d The colonel clearly found this interesting; evidently his philosophy was, the less the aliens knew, the better. Gary Donnelly read the colonel\u2019s expression too and rolled his eyes. I suppressed a smile. Then Colonel Weber asked, \u201cSuppose you were learning a new language by talking to its speakers; could you do it without teaching them English?\u201d \u201cThat would depend on how cooperative the native speakers were.

The MP checked my badge, made a notation on his clipboard, and opened the gate; I drove the o\ufb00-road vehicle into the encampment, a small village of tents pitched by the Army in a farmer\u2019s sun-scorched pasture. At the center of the encampment was one of the alien devices, nicknamed \u201clooking glasses.\u201d According to the brie\ufb01ngs I\u2019d attended, there were nine of these in the United States, one hundred and twelve in the world. The looking glasses acted as twoway communication devices, presumably with the ships in orbit. No one knew why the aliens wouldn\u2019t talk to us in person; fear of cooties, maybe. A team of scientists, including a physicist and a linguist, was assigned to each looking glass; Gary Donnelly and I were on this one. Gary was waiting for me in the parking area. We navigated a circular maze of concrete barricades until we reached the large tent that covered the looking glass itself. In \ueecaont of the tent was an equipment cart loaded with goodies borrowed \ueecaom the school\u2019s phonology lab; I had sent it ahead for inspection by the Army.

Gary held open the tent \ufb02ap and gestured for me to enter. \u201cStep right up,\u201d he said, circus-barker-style. \u201cMarvel at creatures the likes of which have never been seen on God\u2019s green earth.\u201d \u201cAnd all for one slim dime,\u201d I murmured, walking through the door. At the moment the looking glass was inactive, resembling a semicircular mirror over ten feet 5 high and twenty feet across. On the brown grass in \ueecaont of the looking glass, an arc of white spray paint outlined the activation area. Currently the area contained only a table, two folding chairs, and a power strip with a cord leading to a generator outside. The buzz of \ufb02uorescent lamps, hung \ueecaom poles along the edge of the room, commingled with the buzz of \ufb02ies in the sweltering heat. Gary and I looked at each other, and then began pushing the cart of equipment up to the table. As we crossed the paint line, the looking glass appeared to grow transparent; it was as if someone was slowly raising the illumination behind tinted glass. The illusion of depth was uncanny; I felt I could walk right into it. Once the looking glass was fully lit it resembled a life-sized diorama of a semicircular room. The room contained a few large objects that might have been furniture, but no aliens. There was a door in the curved rear wall. We busied ourselves connecting everything together: microphone, sound spec- trograph, portable computer, and speaker. As we worked, I \ueecaequently glanced at the looking glass, anticipating the aliens\u2019 arrival. Even so I jumped when one of them entered. It looked like a barrel suspended at the intersection of seven limbs. It was radially symmetric, and any of its limbs could serve as an arm or a leg. The one in \ueecaont of me was walking around on four legs, three non-adjacent arms curled up at its sides. Gary called them \u201cheptapods.\u201d I\u2019d been shown videotapes, but I still gawked.

I took a deep breath. \u201cReady enough.\u201d I\u2019d done plenty of \ufb01eldwork before, in the Amazon, but it had always been a bilingual procedure: either my informants knew some Portuguese, which I could use, or I\u2019d previously gotten an introduction to their language \ueecaom the local missionaries. This would be my \ufb01rst attempt at conducting a true monolingual discovery procedure. It was straightforward enough in theory, though. I walked up to the looking glass and a heptapod on the other side did the same. The image was so real that my skin crawled. I could see the texture of its gray skin, like corduroy ridges arranged in whorls and loops. There was no smell at all \ueecaom the looking glass, which somehow made the situation stranger. 6 I pointed to myself and said slowly, \u201cHuman.\u201d Then I pointed to Gary. \u201cHuman.\u201d Then I pointed at each heptapod and said, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d No reaction. I tried again, and then again. One of the heptapods pointed to itself with one limb, the four terminal digits pressed together. That was lucky. In some cultures a person pointed with his chin; if the heptapod hadn\u2019t used one of its limbs, I wouldn\u2019t have known what gesture to look for. I heard a brief \ufb02uttering sound, and saw a puckered ori\ufb01ce at the top of its body vibrate; it was talking. Then it pointed to its companion and \ufb02uttered again. I went back to my computer; on its screen were two virtually identical spectro- graphs representing the \ufb02uttering sounds. I marked a sample for playback. I pointed to myself and said \u201cHuman\u201d again, and did the same with Gary. Then I pointed to the heptapod, and played back the \ufb02utter on the speaker. The heptapod \ufb02uttered some more. The second half of the spectrograph for this utterance looked like a repetition: call the previous utterances [\ufb02utter1], then this one was [\ufb02utter2\ufb02utter1]. I pointed at something that might have been a heptapod chair. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d The heptapod paused, and then pointed at the \u201cchair\u201d and talked some more.

He nodded. \u201cNow let\u2019s try something, just for laughs.\u201d I pointed at each heptapod and tried to mimic the sound of [\ufb02utter1], \u201cheptapod.\u201d A\ueecber a long pause, the \ufb01rst heptapod said something and then the second one said something else, neither of whose spec- trographs resembled anything said before. I couldn\u2019t tell if they were speaking to each other or to me since they had no faces to turn. I tried pronouncing [\ufb02utter1] again, but there was no reaction. \u201cNot even close,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m impressed you can make sounds like that at all,\u201d said Gary. \u201cYou should hear my moose call. Sends them running.\u201d 7 I tried again a few more times, but neither heptapod responded with anything I could recognize. Only when I replayed the recording of the heptapod\u2019s pronunciation did I get a con\ufb01rmation; the heptapod replied with [\ufb02utter2], \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re stuck with using recordings?\u201d asked Gary. I nodded. \u201cAt least temporarily.\u201d \u201cSo now what?\u201d \u201cNow we make sure it hasn\u2019t actually been saying \u2018aren\u2019t they cute\u2019 or \u2018look what they\u2019re doing now.\u2019 Then we see if we can identi\ueecd any of these words when that other heptapod pronounces them.\u201d I gestured for him to have a seat. \u201cGet comfortable; this\u2019ll take a while.\u201d In 1770, Captain Cook\u2019s ship Endeavour ran aground on the coast of Queensland, Australia.

It\u2019s almost certainly untrue, and I explain that a\ueecberwards, but it\u2019s a classic anecdote. Of course, the anecdotes my undergraduates will really want to hear are ones featuring the heptapods; for the rest of my teaching career, that\u2019ll be the reason many of them sign up for my courses.

Then it occurred to me that the heptapods must have writing, too.\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d \u201cIf the heptapods have a mechanical way of producing writing, then their writing ought to be very regular, very consistent. That would make it easier for us to identi\ueecd graphemes instead of phonemes. It\u2019s like picking out the letters in a printed sentence instead of trying to hear them when the sentence is spoken aloud.\u201d \u201cI take your point,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd how would you respond to them? Show them the words they displayed to you?\u201d \u201cBasically. And if they put spaces between words, any sentences we write would be a lot more intelligible than any spoken sentence we might splice together \ueecaom recordings.\u201d He leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou know we want to show as little of our technology as possible.\u201d \u201cI understand, but we\u2019re using machines as intermediaries already.

I\u2019m curious whether the heptapods might have di\ufb03culty reading our monitors. Their looking glasses are based on a completely dif- ferent technology than our video screens. As far as we can tell, they don\u2019t use pixels or scan lines, and they don\u2019t re\ueecaesh on a \ueecaame-by-\ueecaame basis.\u201d \u201cYou think the scan lines on our video screens might render them unreadable to the heptapods?\u201d 9 \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d said Gary. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to try it and see.\u201d Weber considered it.

By getting up close to the looking glass, I was able to point to various heptapod body parts, such as limbs, digits, and eyes, and elicit terms for each. It turned out that they had an ori\ufb01ce on the underside of their body, lined with articulated bony ridges: probably used for eating, while the one at the top was for respiration and speech. There were no other conspicuous ori\ufb01ces; perhaps their mouth was their anus too. Those sorts of questions would have to wait. I also tried asking our two informants for terms for addressing each individually; personal names, if they had such things. Their answers were of course unpronounce- able, so for Gary\u2019s and my purposes, I dubbed them Flapper and Raspberry. I hoped I\u2019d be able to tell them apart. The next day I conferred with Gary before we entered the looking-glass tent. \u201cI\u2019ll need your help with this session,\u201d I told him. \u201cSure. What do you want me to do?\u201d \u201cWe need to elicit some verbs, and it\u2019s easiest with third-person forms. Would you act out a few verbs while I type the written form on the computer? If we\u2019re lucky, the heptapods will \ufb01gure out what we\u2019re doing and do the same.

Gary demonstrated each one with a charming lack of self-consciousness; the presence of the video cameras didn\u2019t inhibit him at all. For the \ufb01rst few actions he performed, I asked the heptapods,\u201cWhat do you call that?\u201d Before long, the heptapods caught on to what we were trying to do; Raspberry began mimicking Gary, or at least performing the equivalent heptapod action, while Flapper worked their computer, displaying a written description and pronouncing it aloud. In the spectrographs of their spoken utterances, I could recognize their word I had glossed as \u201cheptapod.\u201d The rest of each utterance was presumably the verb phrase; it looked like they had analogs of nouns and verbs, thank goodness. In their writing, however, things weren\u2019t as clearcut. For each action, they had displayed a single logogram instead of two separate ones.

At \ufb01rst I thought they had written something like \u201cwalks,\u201d with the subject implied. But why would Flapper say \u201cthe heptapod walks\u201d while writing \u201cwalks,\u201d instead of maintaining parallelism? Then I noticed that some of the logograms looked like the logogram for \u201cheptapod\u201d with some extra strokes added to one side or another. Perhaps their verbs could be written 11 as a\ufb03xes to a noun. If so, why was Flapper writing the noun in some instances but not in others? I decided to try a transitive verb; substituting object words might clari\ueecd things. Among the props I\u2019d brought were an apple and a slice of bread. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said to Gary, \u201cshow them the food, and then eat some. First the apple, then the bread.\u201d Gary pointed at the Golden Delicious and then he took a bite out of it, while I displayed the \u201cwhat do you call that?\u201d expression. Then we repeated it with the slice of whole wheat. Raspberry le\ueecb the room and returned with some kind of giant nut or gourd and a gelatinous ellipsoid. Raspberry pointed at the gourd while Flapper said a word and displayed a logogram. Then Raspberry brought the gourd down between its legs, a crunching sound resulted, and the gourd reemerged minus a bite; there were corn- like kernels beneath the shell. Flapper talked and displayed a large logogram on their screen. The sound spectrograph for \u201cgourd\u201d changed when it was used in the sentence; possibly a case marker. The logogram was odd: a\ueecber some study, I could identi\ueecd graphic elements that resembled the individual logograms for \u201cheptapod\u201d and \u201cgourd.\u201d They looked as if they had been melted together, with several extra strokes in the mix that presumably meant \u201ceat.\u201d Was it a multiword ligature? Next we got spoken and written names for the gelatin egg, and descriptions of the act of eating it. The sound spectrograph for \u201cheptapod eats gelatin egg\u201d was analyzable; \u201cgelatin egg\u201d bore a case marker, as expected, though the sentence\u2019s word order di\ufb00ered \ueecaom last time. The written form, another large logogram, was another matter. This time it took much longer for me to recognize anything in it; not only were the individual logograms melted together again, it looked as if the one for \u201cheptapod\u201d was laid on its back, while on top of it the logogram for \u201cgelatin egg\u201d was standing on its head. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d I took another look at the writing for the simple noun-verb examples, the ones that had seemed inconsistent",

This time it took much longer for me to recognize anything in it; not only were the individual logograms melted together again, it looked as if the one for \u201cheptapod\u201d was laid on its back, while on top of it the logogram for \u201cgelatin egg\u201d was standing on its head. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d I took another look at the writing for the simple noun-verb examples, the ones that had seemed inconsistent before. Now I realized all of them actually did contain the logogram for \u201cheptapod\u201d some were rotated and distorted by being combined with the various verbs, so I hadn\u2019t recognized them at \ufb01rst. \u201cYou guys have got to be kidding,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Gary. \u201cTheir script isn\u2019t word-divided; a sentence is written by joining the logograms for the constituent words. They join the logograms by rotating and modi\ueecding them. T ake a look.\u201d I showed him how the logograms were rotated. \u201cSo they can read a word with equal ease no matter how it\u2019s rotated,\u201d Gary said. He turned to look at the heptapods, impressed. \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s a consequence of their bodies\u2019 radial symmetry: their bodies\u2019 radial symmetry: their bodies have no \u2018forward\u2019 direction, so maybe their writing doesn\u2019t either. Highly neat.\u201d 12 I couldn\u2019t believe it; I was working with someone who modi\ufb01ed the word \u201cneat\u201d with \u201chighly.\u201d \u201cIt certainly is interesting,\u201d I said, \u201cbut it also means there\u2019s no easy way for us to write our own sentences in their language. We can\u2019t simply cut their sentences into individual words and recombine them; we\u2019ll have to learn the rules of their script before we can write anything legible. It\u2019s the same continuity problem we\u2019d have had splicing together speech \ueecaagments, except applied to writing.\u201d I looked at Flapper and Raspberry in the looking glass, who were waiting for us to continue, and sighed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to make this easy for us, are you?\u201d T o be fair, the heptapods were completely cooperative. In the days that followed, they readily taught us their language without requiring us to teach them any more English. Colonel Weber and his cohorts pondered the implications of that, while I and the linguists at the other looking glasses met via video conferencing to share what we had learned about the heptapod language. The videoconferencing made for an incongruous working environment: our video screens were primitive compared to the heptapods\u2019 looking glasses, so that my colleagues seemed more remote than the aliens.

For the time being, we worked on the basics: phonemics/graphemics, vocabulary, syntax. The heptapods at every looking glass were using the same language, so we were able to pool our data and coordinate our e\ufb00orts. Our biggest source of confusion was the heptapods\u2019 \u201cwriting.\u201d It didn\u2019t appear to be writing at all; it looked more like a bunch of intricate graphic designs. The logograms weren\u2019t arranged in rows, or a spiral, or any linear fashion. Instead, Flapper or Raspberry would write a sentence by sticking together as many logograms as needed into a giant conglomeration. This form of writing was reminiscent of primitive sign systems, which required a reader to know a message\u2019s context in order to understand it. Such systems were considered too limited for systematic recording of information. Yet it was unlikely that the heptapods developed their level of technology with only an oral tradition. That implied one of three possibilities: the \ufb01rst was that the heptapods had a true writing system, but they didn\u2019t want to use it in \ueecaont of us; Colonel Weber would identi\ueecd with that one. The second was that the heptapods hadn\u2019t originated the technology they were using; they were illiterates using someone else\u2019s technology. The third, and most interesting to me, was that the heptapods were using a nonlinear system of orthography that quali\ufb01ed as true writing.

Once we were inside, I went to the chalkboard and drew a circle with a diagonal line bisecting it. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d \u201c\u2018Not allowed\u2019?\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d Next I printed the words NOT ALLOWED on the chalkboard. \u201cAnd so does this.

However, this symbol\u2014\u201d I indicated the circle and diagonal line \u201c\u2014is \u2018se- masiographic\u2019 writing, because it conveys meaning without reference to speech. There\u2019s no correspondence between its components and any particular sounds.\u201d \u201cAnd you think all of heptapod writing is like this?\u201d \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen so far, yes. It\u2019s not picture writing, it\u2019s far more complex. It has its own system of rules for constructing sentences, like a visual syntax that\u2019s unrelated to the syntax for their spoken language.\u201d \u201cA visual syntax?

You can still combine it with \u2018heptapod\u2019 in the same ways as before, to indicate that the heptapod can hear something clearly or that the heptapod is clearly heard. But what\u2019s really interesting is that the modulation of \u2018hear\u2019 into \u2018hear clearly\u2019 isn\u2019t a special case; you see the transformation they applied?\u201d Gary nodded, pointing. \u201cIt\u2019s like they express the idea of \u2018clearly\u2019 by changing the curve of those strokes in the middle.\u201d \u201cRight. That modulation is applicable to lots of verbs. The logogram for \u2018see\u2019 can be modulated in the same way to form \u2018see clearly,\u2019 and so can the logogram for \u2018read\u2019 and others. And changing the curve of those strokes has no parallel in their speech; with the spoken version of these verbs, they add a pre\ufb01x to the verb to express ease of manner, and the pre\ufb01xes for \u2018see\u2019 and \u2018hear\u2019 are di\ufb00erent. \u201cThere are other examples, but you get the idea. It\u2019s essentially a grammar in two dimensions.\u201d He began pacing thoughtfully. \u201cIs there anything like this in human writing sys- tems?\u201d \u201cMathematical equations, notations for music and dance. But those are all very specialized; we couldn\u2019t record this conversation using them. But I suspect, if we knew it well enough, we could record this conversation in the heptapod writing system. I think it\u2019s a full-\ufb02edged, general-purpose graphical language.\u201d Gary \ueecaowned. \u201cSo their writing constitutes a completely separate language \ueecaom their speech, right?\u201d \u201cRight. In fact, it\u2019d be more accurate to refer to the writing system as \u2018Heptapod B,\u2019 and use \u2018Heptapod A\u2019 strictly for referring to the spoken language.\u201d \u201cHold on a second. Why use two languages when one would su\ufb03ce? That seems unnecessarily hard to learn.\u201d \u201cLike English spelling?\u201d I said. \u201cEase of learning isn\u2019t the primary force in language evolution.

When it came to sen- tences in Heptapod B, though, things became much more confusing. The language had no written punctuation: Its syntax was indicated in the way the semagrams were combined, and there was no need to indicate the cadence of speech. There was certainly no way to slice out subject-predicate pairings neatly to make sentences. A \u201csentence\u201d seemed to be whatever number of semagrams a heptapod wanted to join together; the only di\ufb00erence between a sentence and a paragraph, or a page, was size. When a Heptapod B sentence grew fairly sizable, its visual impact was remarkable. If I wasn\u2019t trying to decipher it, the writing looked like fanciful praying mantids drawn in a cursive style, all clinging to each other to form an Escheresque lattice, each slightly di\ufb00erent in its stance. And the biggest sentences had an e\ufb00ect similar to that of psychedelic posters: sometimes eye-watering, sometimes hypnotic. I remember a picture of you taken at your college graduation.

As time went on, the teams at each looking glass began working in earnest on learning heptapod terminology for elementary mathematics and physics. We worked together on presentations, with the linguists focusing on procedure and the physicists focusing on subject matter. The physicists showed us previously devised systems for communicating with aliens, based on mathematics, but those were intended for use over a radio telescope. We reworked them for face-to-face communication. 17 Our teams were successful with basic arithmetic, but we hit a road block with geometry and algebra. We tried using a spherical coordinate system instead of a rect- angular one, thinking it might be more natural to the heptapods given their anatomy, but that approach wasn\u2019t any more \ueecauitful. The heptapods didn\u2019t seem to understand what we were getting at. Likewise, the physics discussions went poorly. Only with the most concrete terms, like the names of the elements, did we have any success; a\ueecber several attempts at repre- senting the periodic table, the heptapods got the idea. For anything remotely abstract, we might as well have been gibbering. We tried to demonstrate basic physical attributes like mass and acceleration so we could elicit their terms for them, but the heptapods simply responded with requests for clari\ufb01cation. T o avoid perceptual problems that might be associated with any particular medium, we tried physical demonstrations as well as line drawings, photos, and animations; none were e\ufb00ective. Days with no progress became weeks, and the physicists were becoming disillusioned. By contrast, the linguists were having much more success. We made steady progress decoding the grammar of the spoken language, Heptapod A. It didn\u2019t follow the pat- tern of human languages, as expected, but it was comprehensible so far: \ueecaee word order, even to the extent that there was no preferred order for the clauses in a condi- tional statement, in de\ufb01ance of a human language \u201cuniversal.\u201d It also appeared that the heptapods had no objection to many levels of center-embedding of clauses, something that quickly defeated humans.

We regularly asked the heptapods why they had come. Each time, they answered \u201cto see,\u201d or \u201cto observe.\u201d Indeed, sometimes they preferred to watch us silently rather than answer our questions. Perhaps they were scientists, perhaps they were tourists. The State Department instructed us to reveal as little as possible about humanity, in case that information could be used as a bargaining chip in subsequent negotiations. We obliged, though it didn\u2019t require much e\ufb00ort: the heptapods never asked questions about anything. Whether scientists or tourists, they were an awfully incurious bunch.

Like all the sentences I generated myself, this one looked misshapen, like a heptapod-written sentence that had been smashed with a hammer and then inexpertly taped back together. I had sheets of such inelegant semagrams covering my desk, \ufb02uttering occasionally when the oscillating fan swung past. It was strange trying to learn a language that had no spoken form. Instead of practicing my pronunciation, I had taken to squeezing my eyes shut and trying to paint semagrams on the insides of my eyelids.

And not ordinary calculus; you need the calculus of variations. We thought that some simple theorem of geometry or algebra would be the breakthrough.\u201d 20 \u201cCurious indeed.

When did physics become so minimalist?\u201d \u201cWell, the word \u2018least\u2019 is misleading. You see, Fermat\u2019s Principle of Least time is incomplete; in certain situations light follows a path that takes more time than any of the other possibilities. It\u2019s more accurate to say that light always follows an extreme path, either one that minimizes the time taken or one that maximizes it. A minimum and a maximum share certain mathematical properties, so both situations can be described with one equation. So to be precise, Fermat\u2019s Principle isn\u2019t a minimal principle; instead it\u2019s what\u2019s known as a \u2018variational\u2019 principle.\u201d \u201cAnd there are more of these variational principles?\u201d He nodded. \u201cIn all branches of physics. Almost every physical law can be restated as a variational principle. The only di\ufb00erence between these principles is in which attribute is minimized or maximized.\u201d He gestured as if the di\ufb00erent branches of physics were arrayed before him on a table. \u201cIn optics, where Fermat\u2019s Principle applies, time is the attribute that has to be an extreme. In mechanics, it\u2019s a di\ufb00erent attribute. In electromagnetism, it\u2019s something else again. But all these principles are similar mathematically.\u201d \u201cSo once you get their mathematical description of Fermat\u2019s Principle, you should be able to decode the other ones.\u201d \u201cGod, I hope so.

A\ueecber the breakthrough with Fermat\u2019s Principle, discussions of scienti\ufb01c concepts became more \ueecauitful. It wasn\u2019t as if all of heptapod physics was suddenly rendered transparent, but progress was suddenly steady. According to Gary, the heptapods\u2019 formulation of physics was indeed topsy-turvy relative to ours. Physical attributes that humans de\ufb01ned using integral calculus were seen as fundamental by the heptapods. As an example, Gary described an attribute that, in physics jargon, bore the deceptively simple name \u201caction,\u201d which represented \u201cthe di\ufb00erence between kinetic and potential energy, integrated over time,\u201d whatever that meant. Calculus for us; elementary to them. Conversely, to de\ufb01ne attributes that humans thought of as fundamental, like veloc- ity, the heptapods employed mathematics that were, Gary assured me, \u201chighly weird.\u201d The physicists were ultimately able to prove the equivalence of heptapod mathematics and human mathematics; even though their approaches were almost the reverse of one another, both were systems of describing the same physical universe. I tried following some of the equations that the physicists were coming up with, but it was no use. I couldn\u2019t really grasp the signi\ufb01cance of physical attributes like \u201caction;\u201d I couldn\u2019t, with any con\ufb01dence, ponder the signi\ufb01cance of treating such an attribute as fundamental. Still, I tried to ponder questions formulated in terms more familiar to me: what kind of worldview did the heptapods have, that they would consider Fermat\u2019s Principle the simplest explanation of light re\ueecaaction? What kind of perception made a minimum or maximum readily apparent to them? Your eyes will be blue like your dad\u2019s, not mud brown like mine.

It was clear that word order meant next to nothing when speaking in Heptapod A; when asked to re- peat what it had just said, a heptapod would likely as not use a di\ufb00erent word order unless we speci\ufb01cally asked them not to. Was word order similarly unimportant when writing in Heptapod B? Previously, we had only focused our attention on how a sentence in Heptapod B looked once it was complete. As far as anyone could tell, there was no preferred order when reading the semagrams in a sentence; you could start almost anywhere in the nest, then follow the branching clauses until you\u2019d read the whole thing. But that was reading; was the same true about writing? During my most recent session with Flapper and Raspberry I had asked them if, instead of displaying a semagram only a\ueecber it was completed, they could show it to us while it was being written. They had agreed. I inserted the videotape of the session into the VCR, and on my computer I consulted the session transcript. I picked one of the longer utterances \ueecaom the conversation. What Flapper had said was that the heptapods\u2019 planet had two moons, one signi\ufb01cantly larger than the other; the three primary constituents of the planet\u2019s atmosphere were nitrogen, argon, and oxygen; and \ufb01\ueecbeen twenty-eighths of the planet\u2019s surface was covered by water.

The \ufb01rst words of the spoken utterance translated literally as \u201cinequality-of-size rocky- orbiter rocky-orbiters related-as-primary- to-secondary.\u201d Then I rewound the videotape until the time signature matched the one in the transcription. I started playing the tape, and watched the web of semagrams being spun out of inky spider\u2019s silk. I rewound it and played it several times. Finally I \ueecaoze the video right a\ueecber the \ufb01rst stroke was completed and before the second one was begun; all that was visible onscreen was a single sinuous line. 23 Comparing that initial stroke with the completed sentence, I realized that the stroke participated in several di\ufb00erent clauses of the message. It began in the semagram for \u2018oxygen,\u2019 as the determinant that distinguished it \ueecaom certain other elements; then it slid down to become the morpheme of comparison in the description of the two moons\u2019 sizes; and lastly it \ufb02ared out as the arched backbone of the semagram for \u2018ocean.\u2019 Yet this stroke was a single continuous line, and it was the \ufb01rst one that Flapper wrote. That meant the heptapod had to know how the entire sentence would be laid out before it could write the very \ufb01rst stroke. The other strokes in the sentence also traversed several clauses, making them so interconnected that none could be removed without redesigning the entire sentence. The heptapods didn\u2019t write a sentence one semagram at a time; they built it out of strokes irrespective of individual semagrams. I had seen a similarly high degree of integration before in calligraphic designs, particularly those employing the Arabic al- phabet. But those designs had required careful planning by expert calligraphers. No one could lay out such an intricate design at the speed needed for holding a conversa- tion. At least, no human could.

It\u2019s too foreign for me.\u201d \u201cIt would help you discuss physics with them.\u201d \u201cProbably, but since we had our breakthrough, I can get by with just a few phrases.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s fair; I have to admit, I\u2019ve given up on trying to learn the mathematics.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re even?\u201d 24 \u201cWe\u2019re even.\u201d I sipped my tea. \u201cThough I did want to ask you about Fermat\u2019s Principle. Something about it feels odd to me, but I can\u2019t put my \ufb01nger on it. It just doesn\u2019t sound like a law of physics.\u201d A twinkle appeared in Gary\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll bet I know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He snipped a potsticker in half with his chopsticks. \u201cYou\u2019re used to thinking of re\ueecaaction in terms of cause and e\ufb00ect: reaching the water\u2019s surface is the cause, and the change in direction is the e\ufb00ect. But Fermat\u2019s Principle sounds weird because it describes light\u2019s behavior in goal-oriented terms.

People have been talking about it since Fermat \ufb01rst formulated it in the 1600s; Planck wrote volumes about it. The thing is, while the common formulation of physical laws is causal, a variational principle like Fermat\u2019s is purposive, almost teleological.\u201d \u201cHmm, that\u2019s an interesting way to put it.

If the destination were somewhere else, the fastest path would be di\ufb00erent.\u201d Gary nodded again. \u201cThat\u2019s right; the notion of a \u2018fastest path\u2019 is meaningless unless there\u2019s a destination speci\ufb01ed. And computing how long a given path takes also requires information about what lies along that path, like where the water\u2019s surface is.\u201d I kept staring at the diagram on the napkin. \u201cAnd the light ray has to know all that ahead of time, before it starts moving, right?\u201d \u201cSo to speak,\u201d said Gary. \u201cThe light can\u2019t start traveling in any old direction and make course corrections later on, because the path resulting \ueecaom such behavior wouldn\u2019t be the fastest possible one. The light has to do all its computations at the very beginning.\u201d I thought to myself, The ray of light has to know where it will ultimately end up before it can choose the direction to begin moving in.

I practiced Heptapod B at every opportunity, both with the other linguists and by myself. The novelty of reading a semasiographic language made it compelling in a way that Heptapod A wasn\u2019t, and my improvement in writing it excited me. Over time, the sentences I wrote grew shapelier, more cohesive. I had reached the point where it worked better when I didn\u2019t think about it too much. Instead of carefully trying to design a sentence before writing, I could simply begin putting down strokes immediately; my initial strokes almost always turned out to be compatible with an elegant rendition of what I was trying to say. I was developing a faculty like that of the heptapods. More interesting was the fact that Heptapod B was changing the way I thought. For me, thinking typically meant speaking in an internal voice\u2019 as we say in the trade, my thoughts were phonologically coded. My internal voice normally spoke in English, but that wasn\u2019t a requirement. The summer a\ueecber my senior year in high school, I attended a total immersion program for learning Russian; by the end of the Summer, I was thinking and even dreaming in Russian. But it was always spoken Russian. Di\ufb00erent language, same mode: a voice speaking silently aloud. 26 The idea of thinking in a linguistic yet non-phonological mode always intrigued me. I had a \ueecaiend born of deaf parents; he grew up using American Sign Language, and he told me that he o\ueecben thought in ASL instead of English. I used to wonder what it was like to have one\u2019s thoughts be manually coded, to reason using an inner pair of hands instead of an inner voice. With Heptapod B, I was experiencing something just as foreign: my thoughts were becoming graphically coded. There were trance-like moments during the day when my thoughts weren\u2019t expressed with my internal voice; instead, I saw semagrams with my mind\u2019s eye, sprouting like \ueecaost on a windowpane. As I grew more \ufb02uent, semagraphic designs would appear fully-formed, articulat- ing even complex ideas all at once. My thought processes weren\u2019t moving",

Instead of racing forward, my mind hung balanced on the symmetry underlying the semagrams. The semagrams seemed to be something more than lan- guage; they were almost like mandalas. I found myself in a meditative state, contem- plating the way in which premises and conclusions were interchangeable. There was no direction inherent in the way propositions were connected, no \u201ctrain of thought\u201d moving along a particular route; all the components in an act of reasoning were equally powerful, all having identical precedence.

As we listened, I worried that Gary might harm his vision, rolling his eyes so o\ueecben. \u201cThey must have had some reason for coming all this way,\u201d said the diplomat, his voice tinny through the speakers. \u201cIt does not look like their reason was conquest, thank God. But if that\u2019s not the reason, what is? Are they prospectors? Anthropol- ogists? Missionaries? Whatever their motives, there must be something we can o\ufb00er them. Maybe it\u2019s mineral rights to our solar system. May be it\u2019s information about ourselves. Maybe it\u2019s the right to deliver sermons to our populations. But we can be sure that there\u2019s something. \u201cMy point is this: their motive might not be to trade, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we cannot conduct trade. We simply need to know why they\u2019re here, and what we have that they want. Once we have that information, we can begin trade negotiations. \u201cI should emphasize that our relationship with the heptapods need not be ad- versarial. This is not a situation where every gain on their part is a loss on ours, or vice versa. If we handle ourselves correctly, both we and the heptapods can come out winners.\u201d \u201cYou mean it\u2019s a non-zero-sum game?\u201d Gary said in mock incredulity. \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d 27 \u201cA non-zero-sum game.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d You\u2019ll reverse course, heading back \ueecaom your bedroom. \u201cWhen both sides can win: I just remembered, it\u2019s called a non-zero-sum game.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d you\u2019ll say, writing it down on your notebook. \u201cThanks, Mom!\u201d \u201cI guess I knew it a\ueecber all,\u201d I\u2019ll say. \u201cAll those years with your father, some of",

It hasn\u2019t.\u201d As evidence of Gary\u2019s assertion, Hossner kept blathering: \u201cYour immediate tasks is to think back on what you\u2019ve learned. Look for anything that might help us. Has there been any indication of what the heptapods want? Of what they value?\u201d \u201cGee, it never occurred to us to look for things like that,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get right on it, sir.\u201d \u201cThe sad thing is, that\u2019s just what we\u2019ll have to do,\u201d said Gary. \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d asked Hossner. Burghart, the linguist at the Fort Worth looking glass, spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this with the heptapods many times. They maintain that they\u2019re here to observe, and they maintain that information is not tradable.\u201d \u201cSo they would have us believe,\u201d said Hossner. \u201cBut consider: how could that be true? I know that the heptapods have occasionally stopped talking to us for brief periods. That may be a tactical maneuver on their part. If we were to stop talking to them tomorrow\u2014\u201d \u201cWake me up if he says something interesting,\u201d said Gary. \u201cI was just going to ask you to do the same for me.\u201d That day when Gary \ufb01rst explained Fermat\u2019s Principle to me, he had mentioned that almost every physical law could be stated as a variational principle. Yet when humans thought about physical laws, they preferred to work with them in their causal formulation. I could understand that: the physical attributes that humans found in- tuitive, like kinetic energy or acceleration, were all properties of an object at a given moment in time. And these were conductive to a chronological, causal interpretation 28 of events: one moment growing out of another, causes and e\ufb00ects created a chain reaction that grew \ueecaom past to future. In contrast, the physical attributes that the heptapods found intuitive, like \u201caction\u201d or those other things de\ufb01ned by integrals, were meaningful only over a period of time. And these were conductive to a teleological interpretation of events: by viewing events over a period of time,",

All those vows made in childhood that I would give reasonable answers when I became a parent, that I would treat my own child as an intelligent, thinking individual, all for naught: I\u2019m going to turn into my mother. I can \ufb01ght it as much as I want, but there\u2019ll be no stopping my slide down that long, dreadful slope. Was it actually possible to know the future? Not simply to guess at it; was it pos- sible to know what was going to happen, with absolute certainty and in speci\ufb01c detail? Gary once told me that the fundamental laws of physics were time-symmetric, that there was no physical di\ufb00erence between past and future.

She \ufb01nds the passage that describes her \ufb02ipping through the Book of Ages, and she skips to the next column, where it details what she\u2019ll be 29 doing later in the day: acting on information she\u2019s read in the Book, she\u2019ll bet one hundred dollars on the racehorse Devil May Care and win twenty times that much. The thought of doing just that had crossed her mind, but being a contrary sort, she now resolves to re\ueecaain \ueecaom betting on the ponies altogether. There\u2019s the rub. The Book of Ages cannot be wrong; this scenario is based on the premise that a person is given knowledge of the actual future, not of some possible future. If this were Greek myth, circumstances would conspire to make her enact her fate despite her best e\ufb00orts, but prophecies in myth are notoriously vague; the Book of Ages, is quite speci\ufb01c, and there\u2019s no way she can be forced to bet on a racehorse in the manner speci\ufb01ed. The result is a contradiction: the Book of Ages must be right, by de\ufb01nition; yet no matter what the Book says she\u2019ll do, she can choose to do otherwise. How can these two facts be reconciled? They can\u2019t be, was the common answer. A volume like the Book of Ages is a logical impossibility, for the precise reason that its existence would result in the above contradiction. Or, to be generous, some might say that the Book of Ages could exist, as long as it wasn\u2019t accessible to readers: that volume is housed in a special collection, and no one has viewing privileges. The existence of \ueecaee will meant that we couldn\u2019t know the future. And we knew \ueecaee will existed because we had direct experience of it. Volition was an intrinsic part of consciousness. Or was it? What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?

It was a gourmet market, not large, but fancy; tall glass jars stu\ufb00ed with imported foods sat next to specialty utensils on the store\u2019s stainless-steel shelves. 30 I accompanied Gary as he collected \ueecaesh basil, tomatoes, garlic, linguini. \u201cThere\u2019s a \ufb01sh market next door; we can get \ueecaesh clams there,\u201d he said. \u201cSounds good.\u201d We walked past the section of kitchen utensils. My gaze wandered over the shelves\u2014peppermills, garlic presses, salad tongs\u2014and stopped on a wooden salad bowl. When you are three, you\u2019ll pull a dishtowel o\ufb00 the kitchen counter and bring that salad bowl down on top of you. I\u2019ll make a grab for it, but I\u2019ll miss. The edge of the bowl will leave you with a cut, on the upper edge of your forehead, that will require a single stitch. Your father and I will hold you, sobbing and stained with Caesar Salad dressing, as we wait in the emergency room for hours. I reached out and took the bowl \ueecaom the shelf. The motion didn\u2019t feel like some- thing I was forced to do. Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to catch the bowl when it falls on you: an instinct that I felt right in following. \u201cI could use a salad bowl like this.\u201d Gary looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly. \u201cSee, wasn\u2019t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market?\u201d \u201cYes it was.\u201d We got in line to pay for our purchases.

When the ancestors of humans and heptapods \ufb01rst acquired the spark of conscious- ness, they both perceived the same physical world, but they parsed their perceptions di\ufb00erently; the world-views that ultimately across were the end result of that diver- 31 gence. Humans had developed a sequential mode of awareness, while heptapods had developed a simultaneous mode of awareness. We experienced events in an order, and perceived their relationship as cause and e\ufb00ect. They experienced all events at once, and perceived a purpose underlying them all. A minimizing, maximizing purpose. I have a recurring dream about your death.

An orderly li\ueecbs the sheet \ueecaom your face, and I see that you\u2019re twenty-\ufb01ve. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I was sitting upright in bed; I\u2019d woken Gary with my movements. \u201cI\u2019m \ufb01ne. I was just startled; I didn\u2019t recognize where I was for a moment.\u201d Sleepily, he said, \u201cWe can stay at your place next time.\u201d I kissed him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; your place is \ufb01ne.\u201d We curled up, my back against his chest, and went back to sleep. When you\u2019re three and we\u2019re climbing a steep, spiral \ufb02ight of stairs, I\u2019ll hold your hand extra tightly. You\u2019ll pull your hand away \ueecaom me. \u201cI can do it by myself,\u201d you\u2019ll insist, and then move away \ueecaom me to prove it, and I\u2019ll remember that dream. We\u2019ll repeat that scene countless times during your childhood. I can almost believe that, given your contrary nature, my attempts to protect you will be what create your love of climbing: \ufb01rst the jungle gym at the playground, then trees out in the green belt around our neighborhood, the rock walls at the climbing club, and ultimately cli\ufb00 faces in national parks. I \ufb01nished the last radical in the sentence, put down the chalk, and sat down in my desk chair. I leaned back and surveyed the giant Heptapod B sentence I\u2019d written that covered the entire blackboard in my o\ufb03ce. It included several complex clauses, and I had managed to integrate all of them rather nicely. Looking at a sentence like this one, I understood why the heptapods had evolved a 32 semasiographic writing system like Heptapod B; it was better suited for a species with a simultaneous mode of consciousness. For them, speech was a bottleneck because it required that one word follow another sequentially. With writing, on the other hand, every mark on a page was visible simultaneously. Why constrain writing with a glottographic straitjacket, demanding that it be just as sequential as speech? It would never occur to them. Semasiographic writing naturally took advantage of the page\u2019s two-dimensionality; instead of doling out morphemes one at a time, it o\ufb00ered an entire page full of them all at once. And now that Heptapod B had introduced me to a simultaneous mode of con- sciousness, I understood the rationale behind Heptapod A\u2019s grammar: what my se- quential mind had perceived as unnecessarily convoluted, I now recognized as an at- tempt to provide \ufb02exibility within the con\ufb01nes of sequential speech. I could use Hep- tapod A more easily as a result, though it was still a poor substitute for Heptapod B. There was a knock at the door and then Gary poked his head in. \u201cColonel Weber\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d I grimaced. \u201cRight.\u201d",

Gary stepped inside and closed the door. He pulled me out of my chair and kissed me. I smiled. \u201cYou trying to cheer me up before he gets here?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to cheer me up.\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t interested in talking to the heptapods at all, were you? You worked on this project just to get me into bed.\u201d \u201cAh, you see right through me.\u201d I looked into his eyes. \u201cYou better believe it,\u201d I said. I remember when you\u2019ll be a month old, and I\u2019ll stumble out of bed to give you your 2:00 A.M. feeding. Your nursery will have that \u201cbaby smell\u201d of diaper rash cream and talcum powder, with a faint ammoniac whi\ufb00 coming \ueecaom the diaper pail in the corner. I\u2019ll lean over your crib, li\ueecb your squalling form out, and sit in the rocking chair to nurse you. The word \u201cinfant\u201d is derived \ueecaom the Latin word for \u201cunable to speak,\u201d but you\u2019ll be perfectly capable of saying one thing: \u201cI su\ufb00er,\u201d and you\u2019ll do it tirelessly and with- out hesitation. I have to admire your utter commitment to that statement; when you cry, you\u2019ll become outrage incarnate, every \ufb01ber of your body employed in expressing that emotion. It\u2019s funny: when you\u2019re tranquil, you will seem to radiate light, and if someone were to paint a portrait of you like that, I\u2019d insist that they include the 33 halo. But when you\u2019re unhappy, you will become a klaxon, built for radiating sound; a portrait of you then could simply be a \ufb01re alarm bell. At that stage of your life, there\u2019ll be no past or future for you; until I give you my breast, you\u2019ll have no memory of contentment in the past nor expectation of relief in the future. Once you begin nursing, everything will reverse, and all will be right with the world. NOW is the only moment you\u2019ll perceive; you\u2019ll live in the present tense.

What distinguishes the heptapods\u2019 mode of awareness is not just that their actions coincide with history\u2019s events; it is also that their motives coincide with history\u2019s purposes. They act to create the future, to enact chronology. Freedom isn\u2019t an illusion; it\u2019s perfectly real in the context of sequential conscious- ness. Within the context of simultaneous consciousness, \ueecaeedom is not meaningful, but neither is coercion; it\u2019s simply a di\ufb00erent context, no more or less valid than the other. It\u2019s like that famous optical illusion, the drawing of either an elegant young woman, face turned away \ueecaom the viewer, or a wart-nosed crone, chin tucked down on her chest. There\u2019s no \u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation; both are equally valid. But you can\u2019t see both at the same time. Similarly, knowledge of the future was incompatible with \ueecaee will. What made it possible for me to exercise \ueecaeedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know the future. Conversely, now that I know the future, I would never act contrary to that future, including telling others what I know: those who know the future don\u2019t talk about it. Those who\u2019ve read the Book of Ages never admit to it. I turned on the VCR and slotted a cassette of a session \ueecaom the Fort Worth looking glass. A diplomatic negotiator was having a discussion with the heptapods there, with Burghart acting as translator. The negotiator was describing humans\u2019 moral beliefs, trying to lay some ground- work for the concept of altruism. I knew the heptapods were familiar with the con- versation\u2019s eventual outcome, but they still participated enthusiastically. If I could have described this to someone who didn\u2019t already know, she might ask, if the heptapods already knew everything that they would ever say or hear, what was the point of their using language at all? A reasonable question. But language wasn\u2019t only for communication: it was also a form of action. According to speech act theory, statements like \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest,\u201d \u201cI christen this vessel,\u201d or \u201cI promise\u201d were all performative: a speaker could perform the action only by uttering the words. For such acts, knowing what would be said didn\u2019t change anything. Everyone at a 34 wedding anticipated the words \u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife,\u201d but until the minister actually said them, the ceremony didn\u2019t count.

Weber scowled. \u201cAll right then, we\u2019ll see how the State Department feels about this. Maybe we can arrange some kind of gi\ueecb-giving ceremony.\u201d Like physical events, with their causal and teleological interpretations, every lin- guistic event had two possible interpretations: as a transmission of information and as the realization of a plan. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea, Colonel,\u201d I said. It was an ambiguity invisible to most. A private joke; don\u2019t ask me to explain it. Even though I\u2019m pro\ufb01cient with Heptapod B, I know I don\u2019t experience reality the way a heptapod does. My mind was cast in the mold of human, sequential languages, and no amount of immersion in an alien language can completely reshape it. My world-view is an amalgam of human and heptapod. Before I learned how to think in Heptapod B, my memories grew like a col- umn of cigarette ash, laid down by the in\ufb01nitesimal sliver of combustion that was my consciousness, marking the sequential present. A\ueecber I learned Heptapod B, new memories fell into place like gigantic blocks, each one measuring years in duration, and though they didn\u2019t arrive in order or land contiguously, they soon composed a period of \ufb01ve decades. It is the period during which I know Heptapod B well enough to think in it, starting during my interviews with Flapper and Raspberry and ending with my death.

The second display screen that the heptapods had provided began presenting a series of images, composed of semagrams and equations, while one of our video screens did the same. This was the second \u201cgi\ueecb exchange\u201d I had been present for, the eighth one overall, and I knew it would be the last. The looking glass tent was crowded with people; Burghart \ueecaom Fort Worth was here, as were Gary and a nuclear physicist, assorted biologists, anthropologists, military brass, and diplomats. Thankfully they had set up an air conditioner to cool the place o\ufb00. We would review the tapes of the images later to \ufb01gure out just what the heptapods\u2019 \u201cgi\ueecb\u201d was. Our own \u201cgi\ueecb\u201d was a presentation on the Lascaux cave paintings. We all crowded around the heptapods\u2019 second screen, trying to glean some idea of the images\u2019 content as they went by. \u201cPreliminary assessments?\u201d asked Colonel Weber. \u201cIt\u2019s not a return,\u201d said Burghart. In a previous exchange, the heptapods had given us informations about ourselves that we had previously told them. This had infuriated the State Department, but we had no reason to think of it as an insult: it probably indicated that trade value really didn\u2019t play a role in these exchanges. It didn\u2019t exclude the possibility that the heptapods might yet o\ufb00er us a space drive, or cold fusion, or some other wish-ful\ufb01lling miracle. \u201cThat looks like inorganic chemistry,\u201d said the nuclear physicist, pointing at an equation before the image was replaced. Gary nodded. \u201cIt could be materials technology,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re \ufb01nally getting somewhere,\u201d said Colonel Weber. \u201cI wanna see more animal pictures,\u201d I whispered, quietly so that only Gary could hear me, and pouted like a child. He smiled and poked me. Truthfully, I wished the heptapods had given another xenobiology lecture, as they had on two previous exchanges; judging \ueecaom those, humans were more similar to the heptapods than any other species they\u2019d ever encountered.

Gary nodded. \u201cIt could be materials technology,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re \ufb01nally getting somewhere,\u201d said Colonel Weber. \u201cI wanna see more animal pictures,\u201d I whispered, quietly so that only Gary could hear me, and pouted like a child. He smiled and poked me. Truthfully, I wished the heptapods had given another xenobiology lecture, as they had on two previous exchanges; judging \ueecaom those, humans were more similar to the heptapods than any other species they\u2019d ever encountered. Or another lecture on heptapod history; those had been \ufb01lled with apparent non-sequiturs, but were interesting nonetheless. I didn\u2019t want the heptapods to give us new technology, because I didn\u2019t want to see what our governments might do with it. 37 I watched Raspberry while the information was being exchanged, looking for any anomalous behavior. It stood barely moving as usual; I saw no indications of what would happen shortly. A\ueecber a minute, the heptapod\u2019s screen went blank, and a minute a\ueecber that, ours did too. Gary and most of the other scientists clustered around a tiny video screen that was replaying the heptapods\u2019 presentation. I could hear them talk about the need to call in a solid-state physicist. Colonel Weber turned. \u201cYou two,\u201d he said, pointing to me and then to Burghart, \u201cschedule the time and location for the next exchange.\u201d Then he followed the others to the playback screen. \u201cComing right up,\u201d I said. T o Burghart, I asked, \u201cWould you care to do the honors, or shall I?\u201d I knew Burghart had gained a pro\ufb01ciency in Heptapod B similar to mine. \u201cIt\u2019s your looking glass,\u201d he said. \u201cYou drive.\u201d I sat down again at the transmitting computer. \u201cBet you never \ufb01gured you\u2019d wind up working as an Army translator back when you were a grad student.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s for goddamn sure,\u201d he said. \u201cEven now I can hardly believe it.\u201d Everything we said to each other felt like the carefully bland exchanges of spies who meet in public, but never break cover. I wrote out the semagrams for \u201clocus exchange-transaction converse inclusive-we\u201d with the projective aspect modulation. Raspberry wrote its reply. That was my cue to \ueecaown, and for Burghart to ask, \u201cWhat does it mean by that?\u201d His delivery was perfect. I wrote a request for clari\ufb01cation; Raspberry\u2019s reply was the same as before. Then I watched it glide out of the room. The curtain was about to fall on this act of our performance. Colonel Weber stepped forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where did it go?\u201d \u201cIt said that the heptapods are leaving now,\u201d I said. \u201cNot just itself; all of them.\u201d \u201cCall it back here now. Ask it what it means.\u201d \u201cUm, I don\u2019t think Raspberry\u2019s wearing a pager,\u201d I said. The image of the room in the looking glass disappeared so abruptly that it took a moment for my eyes to register what I was seeing instead: it was",

The image of the room in the looking glass disappeared so abruptly that it took a moment for my eyes to register what I was seeing instead: it was the other side of the looking-glass tent. The looking glass had become completely transparent. The conversation around the playback screen fell silent. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d said Colonel Weber. Gary walked up to the looking glass, and then around it to the other side. He touched the rear surface with one hand; I could see the pale ovals where his \ufb01ngertips made contact with the looking glass. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201cwe just saw a demonstration of transmutation at a distance.\u201d 38 I heard the sounds of heavy footfalls on dry grass. A soldier came in through the tent door, short of breath \ueecaom sprinting, holding an oversize walkie-talkie. \u201cColonel, message \ueecaom\u2014\u201d Weber grabbed the walkie-talkie \ueecaom him. I remember what it\u2019ll be like watching you when you are a day old. Your father will have gone for a quick visit to the hospital cafeteria, and you\u2019ll be lying in your bassinet, and I\u2019ll be leaning over you. So soon a\ueecber the delivery, I will still be feeling like a wrung-out towel. You will seem incongruously tiny, given how enormous I felt during the pregnancy; I could swear there was room for someone much larger and more robust than you in there. Your hands and feet will be long and thin, not chubby yet. Your face will still be all red and pinched, pu\ueecf eyelids squeezed shut, the gnome-like phase that precedes the cherubic. I\u2019ll run a \ufb01nger over your belly, marveling at the uncanny so\ueecbness of your skin, wondering if silk would abrade your body like burlap. Then you\u2019ll writhe, twisting your body while poking out your legs one at a time, and I\u2019ll recognize the gesture as one I had felt you do inside me, many times. So that\u2019s what it looks like. I\u2019ll feel elated at this evidence of a unique motherchild bond, this certitude that you\u2019re the one I carried. Even if I had never laid eyes on you before, I\u2019d be able to pick you out \ueecaom a sea of babies: Not that one. No, not her either. Wait, that one over there. Yes, that\u2019s her. She\u2019s mine. That \ufb01nal \u201cgi\ueecb exchange\u201d was the last we ever saw of the heptapods.

Subsequent analysis of the looking glasses revealed them to be nothing more than sheets of fused silica, completely inert. The information \ueecaom the \ufb01nal exchange ses- sion described a new class of superconducting materials, but it later proved to duplicate the results of research just completed in Japan: nothing that humans didn\u2019t already know. We never did learn why the heptapods le\ueecb, any more than we learned what brought them here, or why they acted the way they did. My own new awareness didn\u2019t provide that type of knowledge; the heptapods\u2019 behavior was presumably explicable \ueecaom a sequential point of view, but we never found that explanation. I would have liked to experience more of the heptapods\u2019 world-view, to feel the way they feel. Then, perhaps I could immerse myself fully in the necessity of events, as they must, instead of merely wading in its surf for the rest of my life. But that will never come to pass. I will continue to practice the heptapod languages, as will 39 the other linguists on the looking glass teams, but none of us will ever progress any further than we did when the heptapods were here. Working with the heptapods changed my life. I met your father and learned Hep- tapod B, both of which make it possible for me to know you now, here on the patio in the moonlight. Eventually, many years \ueecaom now, I\u2019ll be without your father, and without you. All I will have le\ueecb \ueecaom this moment is the heptapod language. So I pay close attention, and note every detail. From the beginning I knew my destination, and I chose my route accordingly. But am I working toward an extreme of joy, or of pain? Will I achieve a minimum, or a maximum? These questions are in my mind when your father asks me, \u201cDo you want to make a baby?\u201d And I smile and answer, \u201cYes,\u201d and I unwrap his arms \ueecaom around me, and we hold hands as we walk inside to make love, to make you.",
