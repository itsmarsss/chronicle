        "text": "M CHAPTER ONE THE BOY WHO LIVED r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar \u2014 a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he had seen \u2014 then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive \u2014 no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear people who dressed in funny clothes \u2014 the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald- green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt \u2014 these people were obviously collecting for something . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 yes, their son, Harry \u2014\u201d Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it."

Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her \u2014 if he\u2019d had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . . He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\u2019clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\u201d And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw \u2014 and it didn\u2019t improve his mood \u2014 was the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \u201cAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d \u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early \u2014 it\u2019s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\u201d Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr \u2014 Petunia, dear \u2014 you haven\u2019t heard from your sister lately, have you?\u201d As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister. \u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today . . .\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley. \u201cWell, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do with . . . you know . . . her crowd.\u201d Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son \u2014 he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u201d"

While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \u2014 he yawned and turned over \u2014 it couldn\u2019t affect them . . . . How very wrong he was. Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have known.\u201d He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again \u2014 the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\u201d Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \u201cOh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful, but no \u2014 even the Muggles have noticed something\u2019s going on. It was on their news.\u201d She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living-room window. \u201cI heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent \u2014 I\u2019ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\u201d \u201cI know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in"

People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\u201d She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u2019t, so she went on. \u201cA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\u201d \u201cIt certainly seems so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\u201d \u201cA what ?\u201d \u201cA lemon drop. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m rather fond of.\u201d \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\u2019t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \u201cAs I say, even if You-Know- Who has gone \u2014\u201d \u201cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \u2018You-Know-Who\u2019 nonsense \u2014 for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort. \u201d Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \u201cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u2018You-Know-Who.\u2019 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u201d \u201cI know you haven\u2019t,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \u201cBut you\u2019re different. Everyone knows you\u2019re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\u201d \u201cYou flatter me,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cVoldemort had powers I will never have.\u201d \u201cOnly because you\u2019re too \u2014 well \u2014 noble to use them.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s lucky it\u2019s dark. I haven\u2019t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\u201d Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \u201cThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\u2019s saying? About why he\u2019s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\u201d It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \u201ceveryone\u201d was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying, \u201d she pressed on, \u201cis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\u2019s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are \u2014 are \u2014 that they\u2019re \u2014 dead. \u201d Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \u201cLily and James . . . I can\u2019t believe it . . . I didn\u2019t want to believe it . . . Oh, Albus . . .\u201d Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \u201cI know . . . I know . . .\u201d he said heavily. Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice trembled as she went on. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. They\u2019re saying he tried to kill the Potters\u2019 son, Harry. But \u2014 he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\u2019s power somehow broke \u2014 and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone.\u201d Dumbledore nodded glumly. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s true ?\u201d faltered Professor McGonagall. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s done . . . all the people he\u2019s killed . . . he couldn\u2019t kill a little boy? It\u2019s just astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\u201d \u201cWe can only guess,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe may never know.\u201d Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \u201cHagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u2019d be here, by the way?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to tell me why you\u2019re here, of all places?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u2019re the only family he has left now.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mean \u2014 you can\u2019t mean the people who live here ?\u201d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \u201cDumbledore \u2014 you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been watching them all day. You couldn\u2019t find two people who are less like us. And they\u2019ve got this son \u2014 I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the best place for him,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly. \u201cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\u2019s older. I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u201d \u201cA letter?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \u201cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u2019ll be famous \u2014 a legend \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future"

I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u201d \u201cA letter?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \u201cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u2019ll be famous \u2014 a legend \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future \u2014 there will be books written about Harry \u2014 every child in our world will know his name!\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half- moon glasses. \u201cIt would be enough to turn any boy\u2019s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\u2019t even remember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll be, growing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take it?\u201d Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \u201cYes \u2014 yes, you\u2019re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\u201d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \u201cHagrid\u2019s bringing him.\u201d \u201cYou think it \u2014 wise \u2014 to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\u201d \u201cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI\u2019m not saying his heart isn\u2019t in the right place,\u201d said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \u201cbut you can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not careless. He does tend to \u2014 what was that?\u201d A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \u2014 and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild \u2014 long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. \u201cHagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u201cAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\u201d \u201cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\u201d said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \u201cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\u2019ve got him, sir.\u201d \u201cNo problems, were there?\u201d \u201cNo, sir \u2014 house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\u2019 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\u2019 over Bristol.\u201d Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet- black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. \u201cIs that where \u2014 ?\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall. \u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that scar forever.\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\u201d \u201cEven if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well \u2014 give him here, Hagrid \u2014 we\u2019d better get this over with.\u201d Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\u2019 house. \u201cCould I \u2014 could I say good-bye to him, sir?\u201d asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. \u201cShhh!\u201d hissed Professor McGonagall, \u201cyou\u2019ll wake the Muggles!\u201d \u201cS-s-sorry,\u201d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \u201cBut I c-c-can\u2019t stand it \u2014 Lily an\u2019 James dead \u2014 an\u2019 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles \u2014\u201d \u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\u2019ll be found,\u201d Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u2019s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed to have gone out. \u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore finally, \u201cthat\u2019s that. We\u2019ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019d best get this bike away. G\u2019night, Professor McGonagall \u2014 Professor Dumbledore, sir.\u201d Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. \u201cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs. Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He couldn\u2019t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \u201cTo Harry Potter \u2014 the boy who lived!\u201d"
