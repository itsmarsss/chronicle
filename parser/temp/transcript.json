        "text": "Story of Your Life\nT ed Chiang\n2000\nYour father is about to ask me the question. This is the most important moment\nin our lives, and I want to pay attention, note every detail. Your dad and I have just\ncome back \ueecaom an evening out, dinner and a show; it\u2019s a\ueecber midnight. We came out\nonto the patio to look at the full moon; then I told your dad I wanted to dance, so he\nhumors me and now we\u2019re slow-dancing, a pair of thirtysomethings swaying back and\nforth in the moon-light like kids. I don\u2019t feel the night chill at all. And then your\ndad says, \u201cDo you want to make a baby?\u201d\nRight now your dad and I have been married for about two years, living on Ellis\nAvenue; when we move out you\u2019ll still be too young to remember the house, but we\u2019ll\nshow you pictures of it, tell you stories about it. I\u2019d love to tell you the story of this\nevening, the night you\u2019re conceived, but the right time to do that would be when you\u2019re\nready to have children of your own, and we\u2019ll never get that chance.\nT elling it to you any earlier wouldn\u2019t do any good; for most of your life you won\u2019t\nsit still to hear such a romantic\u2014 you\u2019d say sappy\u2014story. I remember the scenario of\nyour origin you\u2019ll suggest when you\u2019re twelve.\n\u201cThe only reason you had me was so you could get a maid you wouldn\u2019t have to\npay,\u201d you\u2019ll say bitterly, dragging the vacuum cleaner out of the closet.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I\u2019ll say. \u201cThirteen years ago I knew the carpets would need vacu-\numing around now, and having a baby seemed to be the cheapest and easiest way to\nget the job done. Now kindly get on with it.\u201d\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t my mother, this would be illegal,\u201d you\u2019ll say, seething as you unwind\nthe power cord and plug it into the wall outlet.\nThat will be in the house on Belmont Street. I\u2019ll live to see strangers occupy both\nhouses: the one you\u2019re conceived in and the one you grow up in. Your dad and I will\nsell the \ufb01rst a couple years a\ueecber your arrival. I\u2019ll sell the second shortly a\ueecber your\ndeparture. By then Nelson and I will have moved into our farmhouse, and your dad\nwill be living with what\u2019s-her-name."

The government said next to nothing about them, while the tabloids said\nevery possible thing.\nAnd then I got a phone call, a request for a meeting.\nI spotted them waiting in the hallway, outside my o\ufb03ce. They made an odd\ncouple; one wore a military uniform and a crew cut, and carried an aluminum briefcase.\nHe seemed to be assessing his surroundings with a critical eye. The other one was\neasily identi\ufb01able as an academic: full beard and mustache, wearing corduroy. He was\nbrowsing through the overlapping sheets stapled to a bulletin board nearby.\n\u201cColonel Weber, I presume?\u201d I shook hands with the soldier. \u201cLouise Banks.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Banks. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNot at all; any excuse to avoid the faculty meeting.\u201d Colonel Weber indicated his\ncompanion. \u201cThis is Dr. Gary Donnelly, the physicist I mentioned when we spoke\non the phone.\u201d\n\u201cCall me Gary,\u201d he said as we shook hands. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to hear what you have to\nsay.\u201d\nWe entered my o\ufb03ce. I moved a couple of stacks of books o\ufb00 the second guest\nchair, and we all sat down. \u201cYou said you wanted me to listen to a recording. I presume\nthis has something to do with the aliens?\u201d\n\u201cAll I can o\ufb00er is the recording,\u201d said Colonel Weber.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d\nColonel Weber took a tape machine out of his briefcase and pressed PLAY. The\nrecording sounded vaguely like that of a wet dog shaking the water out of its fur.\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d he asked.\nI withheld my comparison to a wet dog. \u201cWhat was the context in which this\nrecording was made?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to say.\u201d\n\u201cIt would help me interpret those sounds. Could you see the alien while it was\nspeaking? Was it doing anything at the time?\u201d\n\u201cThe recording is all I can o\ufb00er.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be giving anything away if you tell me that you\u2019ve seen the aliens; the\npublic\u2019s assumed you have.\u201d\nColonel Weber wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cDo you have any opinion about its linguistic\nproperties?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s clear that their vocal tract is substantially di\ufb00erent \ueecaom a human vocal\ntract. I assume that these aliens don\u2019t look like humans?\u201d\nThe colonel was about to say something noncommittal when Gary Donnelly asked,\n\u201cCan you make any guesses based on the tape?\u201d"

It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re using a larynx to make those sounds, but\nthat doesn\u2019t tell me what they look like.\u201d\n\u201cAnything\u2014is there anything else you can tell us?\u201d asked Colonel Weber.\nI could see he wasn\u2019t accustomed to consulting a civilian. \u201cOnly that establishing\ncommunications is going to be really di\ufb03cult because of the di\ufb00erence in anatomy.\nThey\u2019re almost certainly using sounds that the human vocal tract can\u2019t reproduce, and\nmaybe sounds that the human ear can\u2019t distinguish.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean in\ueecaa- or ultrasonic \ueecaequencies?\u201d asked Gary Donnelly.\n\u201cNot speci\ufb01cally. I just mean that the human auditory system isn\u2019t an absolute\nacoustic instrument; It\u2019s optimized to recognize the sounds that a human larynx makes.\nWith an alien vocal system, all bets are o\ufb00.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll be able to hear\nthe di\ufb00erence between alien phonemes, given enough practice, but it\u2019s possible our\nears simply can\u2019t recognize the distinctions they consider meaningful. In that case\nwe\u2019d need a sound spectrograph to know what an alien is saying.\u201d\nColonel Weber asked, \u201cSuppose I gave you an hour\u2019s worth of recordings; how long\nwould it take you to determine if we need this sound spectrograph or not?\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t determine that with just a recording no matter how much time I had.\nI\u2019d need to talk with the aliens directly.\u201d\nThe colonel shook his head. \u201cNot possible.\u201d\nI tried to break it to him gently. \u201cThat\u2019s your call, of course. But the only way\nto learn an unknown language is to interact with a native speaker, and by that I mean\nasking questions, holding a conversation, that sort of thing. Without that, it\u2019s simply\nnot possible. So if you want to learn the aliens\u2019 language, someone with training in\n\ufb01eld linguistics\u2014 whether it\u2019s me or someone else\u2014will have to talk with an alien.\nRecordings alone aren\u2019t su\ufb03cient.\u201d\nColonel Weber \ueecaowned. \u201cYou seem to be implying that no alien could have learned\nhuman languages by monitoring our broadcasts.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt it. They\u2019d need instructional material speci\ufb01cally designed to teach human\nlanguages to non-humans. Either that, or interaction with a human. If they had either\nof those, they could learn a lot \ueecaom TV, but otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have a starting\npoint.\u201d\nThe colonel clearly found this interesting; evidently his philosophy was, the less\nthe aliens knew, the better. Gary Donnelly read the colonel\u2019s expression too and rolled\nhis eyes. I suppressed a smile.\nThen Colonel Weber asked, \u201cSuppose you were learning a new language by talking\nto its speakers; could you do it without teaching them English?\u201d\n\u201cThat would depend on how cooperative the native speakers were. They\u2019d almost\ncertainly pick up bits and pieces while I\u2019m learning their language, but it wouldn\u2019t"

On the other hand, if they\u2019d rather learn\nEnglish than teach us their language, that would make things far more di\ufb03cult.\u201d\nThe colonel nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on this matter.\u201d\nThe request for that meeting was perhaps the second most momentous phone call\nin my life. The \ufb01rst, of course, will be the one \ueecaom Mountain Rescue. At that point\nyour dad and I will be speaking to each other maybe once a year, tops. A\ueecber I get that\nphone call, though, the \ufb01rst thing I\u2019ll do will be to call your father.\nHe and I will drive out together to perform the identi\ufb01cation, a long silent car\nride. I remember the morgue, all tile and stainless steel, the hum of re\ueecaigeration and\nsmell of antiseptic. An orderly will pull the sheet back to reveal your face. Your face\nwill look wrong somehow, but I\u2019ll know it\u2019s you.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s her,\u201d I\u2019ll say. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll be twenty-\ufb01ve then.\nThe MP checked my badge, made a notation on his clipboard, and opened the\ngate; I drove the o\ufb00-road vehicle into the encampment, a small village of tents pitched\nby the Army in a farmer\u2019s sun-scorched pasture. At the center of the encampment was\none of the alien devices, nicknamed \u201clooking glasses.\u201d\nAccording to the brie\ufb01ngs I\u2019d attended, there were nine of these in the United\nStates, one hundred and twelve in the world. The looking glasses acted as twoway\ncommunication devices, presumably with the ships in orbit. No one knew why the\naliens wouldn\u2019t talk to us in person; fear of cooties, maybe. A team of scientists,\nincluding a physicist and a linguist, was assigned to each looking glass; Gary Donnelly\nand I were on this one.\nGary was waiting for me in the parking area. We navigated a circular maze of\nconcrete barricades until we reached the large tent that covered the looking glass itself.\nIn \ueecaont of the tent was an equipment cart loaded with goodies borrowed \ueecaom the\nschool\u2019s phonology lab; I had sent it ahead for inspection by the Army.\nAlso outside the tent were three tripod-mounted video cameras whose lenses\npeered, through windows in the fabric wall, into the main room. Everything Gary\nand I did would be reviewed by countless others, including military intelligence. In\naddition we would each send daily reports, of which mine had to include estimates on\nhow much English I thought the aliens could understand.\nGary held open the tent \ufb02ap and gestured for me to enter. \u201cStep right up,\u201d he said,\ncircus-barker-style. \u201cMarvel at creatures the likes of which have never been seen on\nGod\u2019s green earth.\u201d\n\u201cAnd all for one slim dime,\u201d I murmured, walking through the door.

Currently the area contained\nonly a table, two folding chairs, and a power strip with a cord leading to a generator\noutside. The buzz of \ufb02uorescent lamps, hung \ueecaom poles along the edge of the room,\ncommingled with the buzz of \ufb02ies in the sweltering heat.\nGary and I looked at each other, and then began pushing the cart of equipment\nup to the table. As we crossed the paint line, the looking glass appeared to grow\ntransparent; it was as if someone was slowly raising the illumination behind tinted\nglass. The illusion of depth was uncanny; I felt I could walk right into it. Once the\nlooking glass was fully lit it resembled a life-sized diorama of a semicircular room.\nThe room contained a few large objects that might have been furniture, but no aliens.\nThere was a door in the curved rear wall.\nWe busied ourselves connecting everything together: microphone, sound spec-\ntrograph, portable computer, and speaker. As we worked, I \ueecaequently glanced at the\nlooking glass, anticipating the aliens\u2019 arrival. Even so I jumped when one of them\nentered.\nIt looked like a barrel suspended at the intersection of seven limbs. It was radially\nsymmetric, and any of its limbs could serve as an arm or a leg. The one in \ueecaont of me\nwas walking around on four legs, three non-adjacent arms curled up at its sides. Gary\ncalled them \u201cheptapods.\u201d\nI\u2019d been shown videotapes, but I still gawked. Its limbs had no distinct joints;\nanatomists guessed they might be supported by vertebral columns. Whatever their\nunderlying structure, the heptapod\u2019s limbs conspired to move it in a disconcertingly\n\ufb02uid manner. Its \u201ctorso\u201d rode atop the rippling limbs as smoothly as a hovercra\ueecb.\nSeven lidless eyes ringed the top of the heptapod\u2019s body. It walked back to the\ndoorway \ueecaom which it entered, made a brief sputtering sound, and returned to the\ncenter of the room followed by another heptapod; at no point did it ever turn around.\nEerie, but logical; with eyes on all sides, any direction might as well be \u201cforward.\u201d\nGary had been watching my reaction. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked.\nI took a deep breath. \u201cReady enough.\u201d I\u2019d done plenty of \ufb01eldwork before, in the\nAmazon, but it had always been a bilingual procedure: either my informants knew\nsome Portuguese, which I could use, or I\u2019d previously gotten an introduction to their\nlanguage \ueecaom the local missionaries. This would be my \ufb01rst attempt at conducting\na true monolingual discovery procedure. It was straightforward enough in theory,\nthough.\nI walked up to the looking glass and a heptapod on the other side did the same.\nThe image was so real that my skin crawled. I could see the texture of its gray skin,\nlike corduroy ridges arranged in whorls and loops. There was no smell at all \ueecaom the\nlooking glass, which somehow made the situation stranger."

I tried again, and then again.\nOne of the heptapods pointed to itself with one limb, the four terminal digits\npressed together. That was lucky. In some cultures a person pointed with his chin;\nif the heptapod hadn\u2019t used one of its limbs, I wouldn\u2019t have known what gesture to\nlook for. I heard a brief \ufb02uttering sound, and saw a puckered ori\ufb01ce at the top of its\nbody vibrate; it was talking. Then it pointed to its companion and \ufb02uttered again.\nI went back to my computer; on its screen were two virtually identical spectro-\ngraphs representing the \ufb02uttering sounds. I marked a sample for playback. I pointed\nto myself and said \u201cHuman\u201d again, and did the same with Gary. Then I pointed to\nthe heptapod, and played back the \ufb02utter on the speaker.\nThe heptapod \ufb02uttered some more. The second half of the spectrograph for this\nutterance looked like a repetition: call the previous utterances [\ufb02utter1], then this one\nwas [\ufb02utter2\ufb02utter1].\nI pointed at something that might have been a heptapod chair. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nThe heptapod paused, and then pointed at the \u201cchair\u201d and talked some more. The\nspectrograph for this di\ufb00ered distinctly \ueecaom that of the earlier sounds: [\ufb02utter3].\nOnce again, I pointed to the \u201cchair\u201d while playing back [\ufb02utter3].\nThe heptapod replied; judging by the spectrograph, it looked like [\ufb02utter3\ufb02utter2].\nOptimistic interpretation: the heptapod was con\ufb01rming my utterances as correct,\nwhich implied compatibility between heptapod and human patterns of discourse. Pes-\nsimistic interpretation: it had a nagging cough.\nAt my computer I delimited certain sections of the spectrograph and typed in a\ntentative gloss for each: \u201cheptapod\u201d for [\ufb02utter1], \u201cyes\u201d for [\ufb02utter2], and \u201cchair\u201d for\n[\ufb02utter3]. Then I typed \u201cLanguage: Heptapod A\u201d as a heading for all the utterances.\nGary watched what I was typing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the \u2018A\u2019 for?\u201d\n\u201cIt just distinguishes this language \ueecaom any other ones the heptapods might use,\u201d\nI said. He nodded.\n\u201cNow let\u2019s try something, just for laughs.\u201d I pointed at each heptapod and tried\nto mimic the sound of [\ufb02utter1], \u201cheptapod.\u201d A\ueecber a long pause, the \ufb01rst heptapod\nsaid something and then the second one said something else, neither of whose spec-\ntrographs resembled anything said before. I couldn\u2019t tell if they were speaking to each\nother or to me since they had no faces to turn. I tried pronouncing [\ufb02utter1] again,\nbut there was no reaction.\n\u201cNot even close,\u201d I grumbled.\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed you can make sounds like that at all,\u201d said Gary.\n\u201cYou should hear my moose call.

The aborigine replied, \u201cKanguru.\u201d From then on Cook and his sailors referred\nto the animals by this word. It wasn\u2019t until later that they learned it meant \u201cWhat did\nyou say?\u201d\nI tell that story in my introductory course every year. It\u2019s almost certainly untrue,\nand I explain that a\ueecberwards, but it\u2019s a classic anecdote. Of course, the anecdotes my\nundergraduates will really want to hear are ones featuring the heptapods; for the rest\nof my teaching career, that\u2019ll be the reason many of them sign up for my courses.

Inside it looked like they were planning an invasion, or perhaps an\nevacuation: crew-cut soldiers worked around a large map of the area, or sat in \ueecaont\nof burly electronic gear while speaking into headsets. We were shown into Colonel\nWeber\u2019s o\ufb03ce, a room in the back that was cool \ueecaom air conditioning.\nWe briefed the colonel on our \ufb01rst day\u2019s results. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like you got very\nfar,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI have an idea as to how we can make faster progress,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to\napprove the use of more equipment.\u201d\n\u201cWhat more do you need?\u201d\n\u201cA digital camera, and a big video screen.\u201d I showed him a drawing of the setup I\nimagined. \u201cI want to try conducting the discovery procedure using writing; I\u2019d display\nwords on the screen, and use the camera to record the words they write. I\u2019m hoping\nthe heptapods will do the same.\u201d\nWeber looked at the drawing dubiously. \u201cWhat would be the advantage of that?\u201d\n\u201cSo far I\u2019ve been proceeding the way I would with speakers of an unwritten lan-\nguage. Then it occurred to me that the heptapods must have writing, too.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cIf the heptapods have a mechanical way of producing writing, then their writing\nought to be very regular, very consistent. That would make it easier for us to identi\ueecd\ngraphemes instead of phonemes. It\u2019s like picking out the letters in a printed sentence\ninstead of trying to hear them when the sentence is spoken aloud.\u201d\n\u201cI take your point,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd how would you respond to them? Show\nthem the words they displayed to you?\u201d\n\u201cBasically. And if they put spaces between words, any sentences we write would\nbe a lot more intelligible than any spoken sentence we might splice together \ueecaom\nrecordings.\u201d\nHe leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou know we want to show as little of our technology\nas possible.\u201d\n\u201cI understand, but we\u2019re using machines as intermediaries already. If we can get\nthem to use writing, I believe progress will go much faster than if we\u2019re restricted to\nthe sound spectrographs.\u201d\nThe colonel turned to Gary. \u201cYour opinion?\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like a good idea to me. I\u2019m curious whether the heptapods might have\ndi\ufb03culty reading our monitors. Their looking glasses are based on a completely dif-\nferent technology than our video screens. As far as we can tell, they don\u2019t use pixels\nor scan lines, and they don\u2019t re\ueecaesh on a \ueecaame-by-\ueecaame basis.\u201d\n\u201cYou think the scan lines on our video screens might render them unreadable to\nthe heptapods?\u201d"

You\u2019ll have a \ueecaiend of yours, a blond girl with the unlikely\nname of Roxie, hanging out with you, giggling.\n\u201cYou may feel the urge to make comments about him,\u201d I\u2019ll say, checking myself in\nthe hallway mirror. \u201cJust restrain yourselves until we leave.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom,\u201d you\u2019ll say. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it so that he won\u2019t know. Roxie, you\nask me what I think the weather will be like tonight. Then I\u2019ll say what I think of\nMom\u2019s date.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Roxie will say.\n\u201cNo, you most de\ufb01nitely will not,\u201d I\u2019ll say.\n\u201cRelax, Mom. He\u2019ll never know; we do this all the time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a comfort that is.\u201d\nA little later on, Nelson will arrive to pick me up. I\u2019ll do the introductions, and\nwe\u2019ll all engage in a little small talk on the \ueecaont porch. Nelson is ruggedly handsome,\nto your evident approval. Just as we\u2019re about to leave, Roxie will say to you casually,\n\u201cSo what do you think the weather will be like tonight?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really hot,\u201d you\u2019ll answer.\nRoxie will nod in agreement. Nelson will say, \u201cReally? I thought they said it was\ngoing to be cool.\u201d\n\u201cI have a sixth sense about these things,\u201d you\u2019ll say. Your face will give nothing\naway.\n\u201cI get the feeling it\u2019s going to be a scorcher. Good thing you\u2019re dressed for it,\nMom.\u201d\nI\u2019ll glare at you, and say good night.

Eventually,\nthe heptapods understood what we wanted, and set up a \ufb02at circular screen mounted\non a small pedestal. One heptapod spoke, and then inserted a limb into a large socket\nin the pedestal; a doodle of script, vaguely cursive, popped onto the screen."

Based on \ufb01rst impressions, their writing appeared\nto be logographic, which was disappointing; I\u2019d been hoping for an alphabetic script to\nhelp us learn their speech. Their logograms might include some phonetic information,\nbut \ufb01nding it would be a lot harder than with an alphabetic script.\nBy getting up close to the looking glass, I was able to point to various heptapod\nbody parts, such as limbs, digits, and eyes, and elicit terms for each. It turned out that\nthey had an ori\ufb01ce on the underside of their body, lined with articulated bony ridges:\nprobably used for eating, while the one at the top was for respiration and speech.\nThere were no other conspicuous ori\ufb01ces; perhaps their mouth was their anus too.\nThose sorts of questions would have to wait.\nI also tried asking our two informants for terms for addressing each individually;\npersonal names, if they had such things. Their answers were of course unpronounce-\nable, so for Gary\u2019s and my purposes, I dubbed them Flapper and Raspberry. I hoped\nI\u2019d be able to tell them apart.\nThe next day I conferred with Gary before we entered the looking-glass tent. \u201cI\u2019ll\nneed your help with this session,\u201d I told him.\n\u201cSure. What do you want me to do?\u201d\n\u201cWe need to elicit some verbs, and it\u2019s easiest with third-person forms. Would you\nact out a few verbs while I type the written form on the computer? If we\u2019re lucky, the\nheptapods will \ufb01gure out what we\u2019re doing and do the same. I\u2019ve brought a bunch of\nprops for you to use.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Gary, cracking his knuckles. \u201cReady when you are.\u201d\nWe began with some simple intransitive verbs: walking, jumping, speaking, writ-\ning. Gary demonstrated each one with a charming lack of self-consciousness; the\npresence of the video cameras didn\u2019t inhibit him at all. For the \ufb01rst few actions he\nperformed, I asked the heptapods,\u201cWhat do you call that?\u201d Before long, the heptapods\ncaught on to what we were trying to do; Raspberry began mimicking Gary, or at least\nperforming the equivalent heptapod action, while Flapper worked their computer,\ndisplaying a written description and pronouncing it aloud.\nIn the spectrographs of their spoken utterances, I could recognize their word I had\nglossed as \u201cheptapod.\u201d The rest of each utterance was presumably the verb phrase; it\nlooked like they had analogs of nouns and verbs, thank goodness.\nIn their writing, however, things weren\u2019t as clearcut. For each action, they had\ndisplayed a single logogram instead of two separate ones. At \ufb01rst I thought they had\nwritten something like \u201cwalks,\u201d with the subject implied. But why would Flapper say\n\u201cthe heptapod walks\u201d while writing \u201cwalks,\u201d instead of maintaining parallelism? Then\nI noticed that some of the logograms looked like the logogram for \u201cheptapod\u201d with\nsome extra strokes added to one side or another. Perhaps their verbs could be written"

If so, why was Flapper writing the noun in some instances but\nnot in others?\nI decided to try a transitive verb; substituting object words might clari\ueecd things.\nAmong the props I\u2019d brought were an apple and a slice of bread. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said to\nGary, \u201cshow them the food, and then eat some. First the apple, then the bread.\u201d\nGary pointed at the Golden Delicious and then he took a bite out of it, while I\ndisplayed the \u201cwhat do you call that?\u201d expression. Then we repeated it with the slice\nof whole wheat.\nRaspberry le\ueecb the room and returned with some kind of giant nut or gourd and\na gelatinous ellipsoid. Raspberry pointed at the gourd while Flapper said a word and\ndisplayed a logogram. Then Raspberry brought the gourd down between its legs, a\ncrunching sound resulted, and the gourd reemerged minus a bite; there were corn-\nlike kernels beneath the shell. Flapper talked and displayed a large logogram on their\nscreen. The sound spectrograph for \u201cgourd\u201d changed when it was used in the sentence;\npossibly a case marker. The logogram was odd: a\ueecber some study, I could identi\ueecd\ngraphic elements that resembled the individual logograms for \u201cheptapod\u201d and \u201cgourd.\u201d\nThey looked as if they had been melted together, with several extra strokes in the mix\nthat presumably meant \u201ceat.\u201d Was it a multiword ligature?\nNext we got spoken and written names for the gelatin egg, and descriptions of\nthe act of eating it. The sound spectrograph for \u201cheptapod eats gelatin egg\u201d was\nanalyzable; \u201cgelatin egg\u201d bore a case marker, as expected, though the sentence\u2019s word\norder di\ufb00ered \ueecaom last time. The written form, another large logogram, was another\nmatter. This time it took much longer for me to recognize anything in it; not only were\nthe individual logograms melted together again, it looked as if the one for \u201cheptapod\u201d\nwas laid on its back, while on top of it the logogram for \u201cgelatin egg\u201d was standing on\nits head.\n\u201cUh-oh.\u201d I took another look at the writing for the simple noun-verb examples,\nthe ones that had seemed inconsistent before. Now I realized all of them actually\ndid contain the logogram for \u201cheptapod\u201d some were rotated and distorted by being\ncombined with the various verbs, so I hadn\u2019t recognized them at \ufb01rst. \u201cYou guys have\ngot to be kidding,\u201d I muttered.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Gary.\n\u201cTheir script isn\u2019t word-divided; a sentence is written by joining the logograms\nfor the constituent words. They join the logograms by rotating and modi\ueecding them.\nT ake a look.\u201d I showed him how the logograms were rotated.\n\u201cSo they can read a word with equal ease no matter how it\u2019s rotated,\u201d Gary said.\nHe turned to look at the heptapods, impressed. \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s a consequence of their\nbodies\u2019 radial symmetry: their bodies\u2019 radial symmetry: their bodies have no \u2018forward\u2019\ndirection, so maybe their writing doesn\u2019t either.

We can\u2019t simply cut their sentences\ninto individual words and recombine them; we\u2019ll have to learn the rules of their script\nbefore we can write anything legible. It\u2019s the same continuity problem we\u2019d have had\nsplicing together speech \ueecaagments, except applied to writing.\u201d\nI looked at Flapper and Raspberry in the looking glass, who were waiting for us\nto continue, and sighed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to make this easy for us, are you?\u201d\nT o be fair, the heptapods were completely cooperative. In the days that followed,\nthey readily taught us their language without requiring us to teach them any more\nEnglish. Colonel Weber and his cohorts pondered the implications of that, while\nI and the linguists at the other looking glasses met via video conferencing to share\nwhat we had learned about the heptapod language. The videoconferencing made for\nan incongruous working environment: our video screens were primitive compared to\nthe heptapods\u2019 looking glasses, so that my colleagues seemed more remote than the\naliens. The familiar was far away, while the bizarre was close at hand.\nIt would be a while before we\u2019d be ready to ask the heptapods why they had come,\nor to discuss physics well enough to ask them about their technology. For the time\nbeing, we worked on the basics: phonemics/graphemics, vocabulary, syntax. The\nheptapods at every looking glass were using the same language, so we were able to\npool our data and coordinate our e\ufb00orts.\nOur biggest source of confusion was the heptapods\u2019 \u201cwriting.\u201d It didn\u2019t appear\nto be writing at all; it looked more like a bunch of intricate graphic designs. The\nlogograms weren\u2019t arranged in rows, or a spiral, or any linear fashion. Instead, Flapper\nor Raspberry would write a sentence by sticking together as many logograms as needed\ninto a giant conglomeration.\nThis form of writing was reminiscent of primitive sign systems, which required\na reader to know a message\u2019s context in order to understand it. Such systems were\nconsidered too limited for systematic recording of information. Yet it was unlikely that\nthe heptapods developed their level of technology with only an oral tradition. That\nimplied one of three possibilities: the \ufb01rst was that the heptapods had a true writing\nsystem, but they didn\u2019t want to use it in \ueecaont of us; Colonel Weber would identi\ueecd\nwith that one. The second was that the heptapods hadn\u2019t originated the technology\nthey were using; they were illiterates using someone else\u2019s technology. The third,\nand most interesting to me, was that the heptapods were using a nonlinear system of\northography that quali\ufb01ed as true writing.\nI remember a conversation we\u2019ll have when you\u2019re in your junior year of high school.\nIt\u2019ll be Sunday morning, and I\u2019ll be scrambling some eggs while you set the table for"

In their written language, however, a noun\nis identi\ufb01ed as subject or object based on the orientation of its logogram relative to\nthat of the verb. Here, take a look.\u201d I pointed at one of the \ufb01gures. \u201cFor instance,\nwhen \u2018heptapod\u2019 is integrated with \u2018hears\u2019 this way, with these strokes parallel, it means\nthat the heptapod is doing the hearing.\u201d I showed him a di\ufb00erent one. \u201cWhen they\u2019re\ncombined this way, with the strokes perpendicular, it means that the heptapod is being\nheard. This morphology applies to several verbs.\n\u201cAnother example is the in\ufb02ection system.\u201d I called up another \ueecaame \ueecaom the\nrecording. \u201cIn their written language, this logogram means roughly \u2018hear easily\u2019 or\n\u2018hear clearly.\u2019 See the elements it has in common with the logogram for \u2018hear\u2019? You\ncan still combine it with \u2018heptapod\u2019 in the same ways as before, to indicate that the\nheptapod can hear something clearly or that the heptapod is clearly heard. But what\u2019s\nreally interesting is that the modulation of \u2018hear\u2019 into \u2018hear clearly\u2019 isn\u2019t a special case;\nyou see the transformation they applied?\u201d\nGary nodded, pointing. \u201cIt\u2019s like they express the idea of \u2018clearly\u2019 by changing the\ncurve of those strokes in the middle.\u201d\n\u201cRight. That modulation is applicable to lots of verbs. The logogram for \u2018see\u2019 can\nbe modulated in the same way to form \u2018see clearly,\u2019 and so can the logogram for \u2018read\u2019\nand others. And changing the curve of those strokes has no parallel in their speech;\nwith the spoken version of these verbs, they add a pre\ufb01x to the verb to express ease of\nmanner, and the pre\ufb01xes for \u2018see\u2019 and \u2018hear\u2019 are di\ufb00erent.\n\u201cThere are other examples, but you get the idea. It\u2019s essentially a grammar in two\ndimensions.\u201d\nHe began pacing thoughtfully. \u201cIs there anything like this in human writing sys-\ntems?\u201d\n\u201cMathematical equations, notations for music and dance. But those are all very\nspecialized; we couldn\u2019t record this conversation using them. But I suspect, if we knew\nit well enough, we could record this conversation in the heptapod writing system. I\nthink it\u2019s a full-\ufb02edged, general-purpose graphical language.\u201d\nGary \ueecaowned. \u201cSo their writing constitutes a completely separate language \ueecaom\ntheir speech, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight. In fact, it\u2019d be more accurate to refer to the writing system as \u2018Heptapod\nB,\u2019 and use \u2018Heptapod A\u2019 strictly for referring to the spoken language.\u201d\n\u201cHold on a second. Why use two languages when one would su\ufb03ce? That seems\nunnecessarily hard to learn.\u201d\n\u201cLike English spelling?\u201d I said. \u201cEase of learning isn\u2019t the primary force in language\nevolution. For the heptapods, writing and speech may play such di\ufb00erent cultural or\ncognitive roles that using separate languages makes more sense than using di\ufb00erent\nforms of the same one.\u201d"

We worked\ntogether on presentations, with the linguists focusing on procedure and the physicists\nfocusing on subject matter. The physicists showed us previously devised systems for\ncommunicating with aliens, based on mathematics, but those were intended for use\nover a radio telescope. We reworked them for face-to-face communication."

We tried using a spherical coordinate system instead of a rect-\nangular one, thinking it might be more natural to the heptapods given their anatomy,\nbut that approach wasn\u2019t any more \ueecauitful. The heptapods didn\u2019t seem to understand\nwhat we were getting at.\nLikewise, the physics discussions went poorly. Only with the most concrete terms,\nlike the names of the elements, did we have any success; a\ueecber several attempts at repre-\nsenting the periodic table, the heptapods got the idea. For anything remotely abstract,\nwe might as well have been gibbering. We tried to demonstrate basic physical attributes\nlike mass and acceleration so we could elicit their terms for them, but the heptapods\nsimply responded with requests for clari\ufb01cation. T o avoid perceptual problems that\nmight be associated with any particular medium, we tried physical demonstrations\nas well as line drawings, photos, and animations; none were e\ufb00ective. Days with no\nprogress became weeks, and the physicists were becoming disillusioned.\nBy contrast, the linguists were having much more success. We made steady progress\ndecoding the grammar of the spoken language, Heptapod A. It didn\u2019t follow the pat-\ntern of human languages, as expected, but it was comprehensible so far: \ueecaee word\norder, even to the extent that there was no preferred order for the clauses in a condi-\ntional statement, in de\ufb01ance of a human language \u201cuniversal.\u201d It also appeared that the\nheptapods had no objection to many levels of center-embedding of clauses, something\nthat quickly defeated humans. Peculiar, but not impenetrable.\nMuch more interesting were the newly discovered morphological and grammat-\nical processes in Heptapod B that were uniquely two-dimensional. Depending on a\nsemagram\u2019s declension, in\ufb02ections could be indicated by varying a certain stroke\u2019s cur-\nvature, or its thickness, or its manner of undulation; or by varying the relative sizes\nof two radicals, or their relative distance to another radical, or their orientations; or\nvarious other means. These were non-segmental graphemes; they couldn\u2019t be isolated\n\ueecaom the rest of a semagram. And despite how such traits behaved in human writing,\nthese had nothing to do with calligraphic style; their meanings were de\ufb01ned according\nto a consistent and unambiguous grammar.\nWe regularly asked the heptapods why they had come. Each time, they answered\n\u201cto see,\u201d or \u201cto observe.\u201d Indeed, sometimes they preferred to watch us silently rather\nthan answer our questions. Perhaps they were scientists, perhaps they were tourists.\nThe State Department instructed us to reveal as little as possible about humanity, in\ncase that information could be used as a bargaining chip in subsequent negotiations.\nWe obliged, though it didn\u2019t require much e\ufb00ort: the heptapods never asked questions\nabout anything. Whether scientists or tourists, they were an awfully incurious bunch.\nI remember once when we\u2019ll be driving to the mall to buy some new clothes for"

Let me show you\nwhat it is.\u201d He started erasing my blackboard.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t need any of that.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d He picked up a nub of chalk and drew a diagram: \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the path\na ray of light takes when crossing \ueecaom air to water. The light ray travels in a straight\nline until it hits the water; the water has a di\ufb00erent index of re\ueecaaction, so the light\nchanges direction. You\u2019ve heard of this before, right?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cNow here\u2019s an interesting property about the path the light takes. The path is\nthe fastest possible route between these two points.\u201d\n\u201cCome again?\u201d\n\u201cImagine, just for grins, that the ray of light traveled along this path.\u201d He added a\ndotted line to his diagram: \u201cThis hypothetical path is shorter than the path the light\nactually takes. But light travels more slowly in water than it does in air, and a greater\npercentage of this path is underwater. So it would take longer for light to travel along\nthis path than it does along the real path.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I get it.\u201d\n\u201cNow imagine if light were to travel along this other path.\u201d He drew a second\ndotted path: \u201cThis path reduces the percentage that\u2019s underwater, but the total length\nis larger. It would also take longer for light to travel along this path than along the\nactual one.\u201d\nGary put down the chalk and gestured at the diagram on the chalkboard with\nwhite-tipped \ufb01ngers. \u201cAny hypothetical path would require more time to traverse\nthan the one actually taken. In other words, the route that the light ray takes is always\nthe fastest possible one. That\u2019s Fermat\u2019s Principle of Least Time\u201d\n\u201cHumm, interesting. And this is what the heptapods responded to?\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Moorehead gave an animated presentation of Fermat\u2019s Principle at the\nIllinois looking glass, and the heptapods repeated it back. Now he\u2019s trying to get a\nsymbolic description.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNow is that highly neat, or what?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s neat all right, but how come I haven\u2019t heard of Fermat\u2019s Principle before?\u201d I\npicked up a binder and waved it at him; it was a primer on the physics topics sug-\ngested for use in communication with the heptapods. \u201cThis thing goes on forever\nabout Planck masses and the spin-\ufb02ip of atomic hydrogen, and not a word about the\nre\ueecaaction of light.\u201d\n\u201cWe guessed wrong about what\u2019d be most useful for you to know,\u201d Gary said\nwithout embarrassment. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s curious that Fermat\u2019s Principle was the \ufb01rst\nbreakthrough; even though it\u2019s easy to explain, you need calculus to describe it mathe-\nmatically. And not ordinary calculus; you need the calculus of variations. We thought\nthat some simple theorem of geometry or algebra would be the breakthrough.\u201d"

You think the heptapods\u2019 idea of what\u2019s simple doesn\u2019t match\nours?\u201d\n\u201cExactly, which is why I\u2019m dying to see what their mathematical description of\nFermat\u2019s Principle looks like.\u201d He paced as he talked. \u201cIf their version of the calculus\nof variations is simpler to them than their equivalent of algebra, that might explain why\nwe\u2019ve had so much trouble talking about physics; their entire system of mathematics\nmay be topsyturvy compared to ours.\u201d He pointed to the physics primer. \u201cYou can be\nsure that we\u2019re going to revise that.\u201d\n\u201cSo can you build \ueecaom Fermat\u2019s Principle to other areas of physics?\u201d\n\u201cProbably. There are lots of physical principles just like Fermat\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, like Louise\u2019s principle of least closet space? When did physics become so\nminimalist?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the word \u2018least\u2019 is misleading. You see, Fermat\u2019s Principle of Least time\nis incomplete; in certain situations light follows a path that takes more time than\nany of the other possibilities. It\u2019s more accurate to say that light always follows an\nextreme path, either one that minimizes the time taken or one that maximizes it. A\nminimum and a maximum share certain mathematical properties, so both situations\ncan be described with one equation. So to be precise, Fermat\u2019s Principle isn\u2019t a minimal\nprinciple; instead it\u2019s what\u2019s known as a \u2018variational\u2019 principle.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there are more of these variational principles?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cIn all branches of physics. Almost every physical law can be restated\nas a variational principle. The only di\ufb00erence between these principles is in which\nattribute is minimized or maximized.\u201d He gestured as if the di\ufb00erent branches of\nphysics were arrayed before him on a table. \u201cIn optics, where Fermat\u2019s Principle applies,\ntime is the attribute that has to be an extreme. In mechanics, it\u2019s a di\ufb00erent attribute.\nIn electromagnetism, it\u2019s something else again. But all these principles are similar\nmathematically.\u201d\n\u201cSo once you get their mathematical description of Fermat\u2019s Principle, you should\nbe able to decode the other ones.\u201d\n\u201cGod, I hope so. I think this is the wedge that we\u2019ve been looking for, the one\nthat cracks open their formulation of physics. This calls for a celebration.\u201d He stopped\nhis pacing and turned to me. \u201cHey Louise, want to go out for dinner? My treat.\u201d\nI was mildly surprised. \u201cSure,\u201d I said.\nIt\u2019ll be when you \ufb01rst learn to walk that I get daily demonstrations of the asym-\nmetry in our relationship. You\u2019ll be incessantly running o\ufb00 somewhere, and each time\nyou walk into a door \ueecaame or scrape your knee, the pain feels like it\u2019s my own.

It wasn\u2019t as if all of heptapod physics was suddenly rendered\ntransparent, but progress was suddenly steady. According to Gary, the heptapods\u2019\nformulation of physics was indeed topsy-turvy relative to ours. Physical attributes that\nhumans de\ufb01ned using integral calculus were seen as fundamental by the heptapods. As\nan example, Gary described an attribute that, in physics jargon, bore the deceptively\nsimple name \u201caction,\u201d which represented \u201cthe di\ufb00erence between kinetic and potential\nenergy, integrated over time,\u201d whatever that meant. Calculus for us; elementary to\nthem.\nConversely, to de\ufb01ne attributes that humans thought of as fundamental, like veloc-\nity, the heptapods employed mathematics that were, Gary assured me, \u201chighly weird.\u201d\nThe physicists were ultimately able to prove the equivalence of heptapod mathematics\nand human mathematics; even though their approaches were almost the reverse of one\nanother, both were systems of describing the same physical universe.\nI tried following some of the equations that the physicists were coming up with,\nbut it was no use. I couldn\u2019t really grasp the signi\ufb01cance of physical attributes like\n\u201caction;\u201d I couldn\u2019t, with any con\ufb01dence, ponder the signi\ufb01cance of treating such an\nattribute as fundamental. Still, I tried to ponder questions formulated in terms more\nfamiliar to me: what kind of worldview did the heptapods have, that they would\nconsider Fermat\u2019s Principle the simplest explanation of light re\ueecaaction? What kind of\nperception made a minimum or maximum readily apparent to them?\nYour eyes will be blue like your dad\u2019s, not mud brown like mine.

It was clear that\nword order meant next to nothing when speaking in Heptapod A; when asked to re-\npeat what it had just said, a heptapod would likely as not use a di\ufb00erent word order\nunless we speci\ufb01cally asked them not to. Was word order similarly unimportant when\nwriting in Heptapod B?\nPreviously, we had only focused our attention on how a sentence in Heptapod B\nlooked once it was complete. As far as anyone could tell, there was no preferred order\nwhen reading the semagrams in a sentence; you could start almost anywhere in the\nnest, then follow the branching clauses until you\u2019d read the whole thing. But that was\nreading; was the same true about writing?\nDuring my most recent session with Flapper and Raspberry I had asked them if,\ninstead of displaying a semagram only a\ueecber it was completed, they could show it to us\nwhile it was being written. They had agreed. I inserted the videotape of the session\ninto the VCR, and on my computer I consulted the session transcript.\nI picked one of the longer utterances \ueecaom the conversation. What Flapper had\nsaid was that the heptapods\u2019 planet had two moons, one signi\ufb01cantly larger than the\nother; the three primary constituents of the planet\u2019s atmosphere were nitrogen, argon,\nand oxygen; and \ufb01\ueecbeen twenty-eighths of the planet\u2019s surface was covered by water.\nThe \ufb01rst words of the spoken utterance translated literally as \u201cinequality-of-size rocky-\norbiter rocky-orbiters related-as-primary- to-secondary.\u201d\nThen I rewound the videotape until the time signature matched the one in the\ntranscription. I started playing the tape, and watched the web of semagrams being\nspun out of inky spider\u2019s silk. I rewound it and played it several times.

That meant the heptapod had to know how the entire sentence would\nbe laid out before it could write the very \ufb01rst stroke.\nThe other strokes in the sentence also traversed several clauses, making them so\ninterconnected that none could be removed without redesigning the entire sentence.\nThe heptapods didn\u2019t write a sentence one semagram at a time; they built it out of\nstrokes irrespective of individual semagrams. I had seen a similarly high degree of\nintegration before in calligraphic designs, particularly those employing the Arabic al-\nphabet.

It just\ndoesn\u2019t sound like a law of physics.\u201d\nA twinkle appeared in Gary\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll bet I know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He\nsnipped a potsticker in half with his chopsticks. \u201cYou\u2019re used to thinking of re\ueecaaction\nin terms of cause and e\ufb00ect: reaching the water\u2019s surface is the cause, and the change in\ndirection is the e\ufb00ect. But Fermat\u2019s Principle sounds weird because it describes light\u2019s\nbehavior in goal-oriented terms. It sounds like a commandment to a light beam:\n\u2018Thou shalt minimize or maximize the time taken to reach thy destination.\u2019\u201d\nI considered it. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old question in the philosophy of physics. People have been talking about it\nsince Fermat \ufb01rst formulated it in the 1600s; Planck wrote volumes about it. The thing\nis, while the common formulation of physical laws is causal, a variational principle like\nFermat\u2019s is purposive, almost teleological.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, that\u2019s an interesting way to put it. Let me think about that for a minute.\u201d\nI pulled out a felt-tip pen and, on my paper napkin, drew a copy of the diagram that\nGary had drawn on my blackboard. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, thinking aloud, \u201cSo let\u2019s say the\ngoal of a ray of light is to take the fastest path. How does the light go about doing\nthat?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if I can speak anthropomorphic-projectionally, the light has to examine\nthe possible paths and compute how long each one would take.\u201d He plucked the last\npotsticker \ueecaom the serving dish.\n\u201cAnd to do that,\u201d I continued, \u201cthe ray of light has to know just where its destina-\ntion is.

The light has to do all its computations at the\nvery beginning.\u201d\nI thought to myself, The ray of light has to know where it will ultimately end up\nbefore it can choose the direction to begin moving in.

Instead of carefully\ntrying to design a sentence before writing, I could simply begin putting down strokes\nimmediately; my initial strokes almost always turned out to be compatible with an\nelegant rendition of what I was trying to say. I was developing a faculty like that of\nthe heptapods.\nMore interesting was the fact that Heptapod B was changing the way I thought.\nFor me, thinking typically meant speaking in an internal voice\u2019 as we say in the trade,\nmy thoughts were phonologically coded. My internal voice normally spoke in English,\nbut that wasn\u2019t a requirement.

I had a \ueecaiend born of deaf parents; he grew up using American Sign Language,\nand he told me that he o\ueecben thought in ASL instead of English. I used to wonder\nwhat it was like to have one\u2019s thoughts be manually coded, to reason using an inner pair\nof hands instead of an inner voice. With Heptapod B, I was experiencing something\njust as foreign: my thoughts were becoming graphically coded. There were trance-like\nmoments during the day when my thoughts weren\u2019t expressed with my internal voice;\ninstead, I saw semagrams with my mind\u2019s eye, sprouting like \ueecaost on a windowpane.\nAs I grew more \ufb02uent, semagraphic designs would appear fully-formed, articulat-\ning even complex ideas all at once. My thought processes weren\u2019t moving any faster as\na result, though. Instead of racing forward, my mind hung balanced on the symmetry\nunderlying the semagrams. The semagrams seemed to be something more than lan-\nguage; they were almost like mandalas. I found myself in a meditative state, contem-\nplating the way in which premises and conclusions were interchangeable. There was\nno direction inherent in the way propositions were connected, no \u201ctrain of thought\u201d\nmoving along a particular route; all the components in an act of reasoning were equally\npowerful, all having identical precedence.\nA representative \ueecaom the State Department named Hossner had the job of brie\ufb01ng\nthe U.S scientists on our agenda with the heptapods. We sat in the videoconference\nroom, listening to him lecture. Our microphone was turned o\ufb00, so Gary and I could\nexchange comments without interrupting Hossner. As we listened, I worried that Gary\nmight harm his vision, rolling his eyes so o\ueecben.\n\u201cThey must have had some reason for coming all this way,\u201d said the diplomat, his\nvoice tinny through the speakers. \u201cIt does not look like their reason was conquest,\nthank God. But if that\u2019s not the reason, what is? Are they prospectors? Anthropol-\nogists? Missionaries? Whatever their motives, there must be something we can o\ufb00er\nthem. Maybe it\u2019s mineral rights to our solar system. May be it\u2019s information about\nourselves. Maybe it\u2019s the right to deliver sermons to our populations. But we can be\nsure that there\u2019s something.\n\u201cMy point is this: their motive might not be to trade, but that doesn\u2019t mean that\nwe cannot conduct trade. We simply need to know why they\u2019re here, and what we\nhave that they want. Once we have that information, we can begin trade negotiations.\n\u201cI should emphasize that our relationship with the heptapods need not be ad-\nversarial. This is not a situation where every gain on their part is a loss on ours, or\nvice versa. If we handle ourselves correctly, both we and the heptapods can come out\nwinners.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it\u2019s a non-zero-sum game?\u201d Gary said in mock incredulity. \u201cOh my\ngosh.\u201d"

Yet when\nhumans thought about physical laws, they preferred to work with them in their causal\nformulation.

The Book of Ages cannot be wrong; this scenario is based on the\npremise that a person is given knowledge of the actual future, not of some possible\nfuture. If this were Greek myth, circumstances would conspire to make her enact her\nfate despite her best e\ufb00orts, but prophecies in myth are notoriously vague; the Book\nof Ages, is quite speci\ufb01c, and there\u2019s no way she can be forced to bet on a racehorse\nin the manner speci\ufb01ed. The result is a contradiction: the Book of Ages must be\nright, by de\ufb01nition; yet no matter what the Book says she\u2019ll do, she can choose to do\notherwise. How can these two facts be reconciled?\nThey can\u2019t be, was the common answer. A volume like the Book of Ages is a\nlogical impossibility, for the precise reason that its existence would result in the above\ncontradiction.

But when you\u2019re unhappy, you will become a klaxon, built for radiating sound;\na portrait of you then could simply be a \ufb01re alarm bell.\nAt that stage of your life, there\u2019ll be no past or future for you; until I give you my\nbreast, you\u2019ll have no memory of contentment in the past nor expectation of relief in\nthe future. Once you begin nursing, everything will reverse, and all will be right with\nthe world. NOW is the only moment you\u2019ll perceive; you\u2019ll live in the present tense.\nIn many ways, it\u2019s an enviable state.\nThe heptapods are neither \ueecaee nor bound as we understand those concepts; they\ndon\u2019t act according to their will, nor are they helpless automatons. What distinguishes\nthe heptapods\u2019 mode of awareness is not just that their actions coincide with history\u2019s\nevents; it is also that their motives coincide with history\u2019s purposes. They act to create\nthe future, to enact chronology.\nFreedom isn\u2019t an illusion; it\u2019s perfectly real in the context of sequential conscious-\nness. Within the context of simultaneous consciousness, \ueecaeedom is not meaningful,\nbut neither is coercion; it\u2019s simply a di\ufb00erent context, no more or less valid than the\nother. It\u2019s like that famous optical illusion, the drawing of either an elegant young\nwoman, face turned away \ueecaom the viewer, or a wart-nosed crone, chin tucked down\non her chest. There\u2019s no \u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation; both are equally valid. But you can\u2019t\nsee both at the same time.\nSimilarly, knowledge of the future was incompatible with \ueecaee will. What made it\npossible for me to exercise \ueecaeedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know\nthe future. Conversely, now that I know the future, I would never act contrary to that\nfuture, including telling others what I know: those who know the future don\u2019t talk\nabout it. Those who\u2019ve read the Book of Ages never admit to it.\nI turned on the VCR and slotted a cassette of a session \ueecaom the Fort Worth\nlooking glass. A diplomatic negotiator was having a discussion with the heptapods\nthere, with Burghart acting as translator.\nThe negotiator was describing humans\u2019 moral beliefs, trying to lay some ground-\nwork for the concept of altruism. I knew the heptapods were familiar with the con-\nversation\u2019s eventual outcome, but they still participated enthusiastically.\nIf I could have described this to someone who didn\u2019t already know, she might\nask, if the heptapods already knew everything that they would ever say or hear, what\nwas the point of their using language at all? A reasonable question. But language\nwasn\u2019t only for communication: it was also a form of action. According to speech act\ntheory, statements like \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest,\u201d \u201cI christen this vessel,\u201d or \u201cI promise\u201d\nwere all performative: a speaker could perform the action only by uttering the words.\nFor such acts, knowing what would be said didn\u2019t change anything.

I asked them if we\ncould make a request, and they said we could, but it won\u2019t make them tell us what\nthey\u2019re giving.\u201d I suddenly remembered that a morphological relative of \u201cperformative\u201d\nwas \u201cperformance,\u201d which could describe the sensation of conversing when you knew\nwhat would be said: it was like performing in a play."

He was perfectly oblivious of the script, yet his responses matched his assigned\nlines exactly.\n\u201cNo way of knowing,\u201d I said. \u201cI doubt it, given that it\u2019s not a custom they engage\nin.\u201d\n\u201cIf we give our gi\ueecb \ufb01rst, will the value of our gi\ueecb in\ufb02uence the value of theirs?\u201d\nHe was improvising, while I had carefully rehearsed for this one and only show.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cAs far as we can tell, the value of the exchanged items is irrelevant.\u201d\n\u201cIf only my relatives felt that way,\u201d murmured Gary wryly.\nI watched Colonel Weber turn to Gary. \u201cHave you discovered anything new in the\nphysics discussions?\u201d he asked right on cue.\n\u201cIf you mean, any information new to mankind, no,\u201d said Gary. \u201cThe heptapods\nhaven\u2019t varied \ueecaom the routine. If we demonstrate something to them, they\u2019ll show\nus their formulation of it, but they won\u2019t volunteer anything and they won\u2019t answer\nour questions about what they know.\u201d\nAn utterance that was spontaneous and communicative in the context of human\ndiscourse became a ritual recitation when viewed by the light of Heptapod B.\nWeber scowled. \u201cAll right then, we\u2019ll see how the State Department feels about\nthis. Maybe we can arrange some kind of gi\ueecb-giving ceremony.\u201d\nLike physical events, with their causal and teleological interpretations, every lin-\nguistic event had two possible interpretations: as a transmission of information and\nas the realization of a plan.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea, Colonel,\u201d I said.\nIt was an ambiguity invisible to most. A private joke; don\u2019t ask me to explain it.\nEven though I\u2019m pro\ufb01cient with Heptapod B, I know I don\u2019t experience reality the\nway a heptapod does. My mind was cast in the mold of human, sequential languages,\nand no amount of immersion in an alien language can completely reshape it. My\nworld-view is an amalgam of human and heptapod.\nBefore I learned how to think in Heptapod B, my memories grew like a col-\numn of cigarette ash, laid down by the in\ufb01nitesimal sliver of combustion that was\nmy consciousness, marking the sequential present. A\ueecber I learned Heptapod B, new\nmemories fell into place like gigantic blocks, each one measuring years in duration,\nand though they didn\u2019t arrive in order or land contiguously, they soon composed a\nperiod of \ufb01ve decades. It is the period during which I know Heptapod B well enough\nto think in it, starting during my interviews with Flapper and Raspberry and ending\nwith my death.\nUsually, Heptapod B a\ufb00ects just my memory: my consciousness crawls along as it\ndid before, a glowing sliver crawling forward in time, the di\ufb00erence being that the ash"

The\nsecond display screen that the heptapods had provided began presenting a series of\nimages, composed of semagrams and equations, while one of our video screens did the\nsame.\nThis was the second \u201cgi\ueecb exchange\u201d I had been present for, the eighth one overall,\nand I knew it would be the last. The looking glass tent was crowded with people;\nBurghart \ueecaom Fort Worth was here, as were Gary and a nuclear physicist, assorted\nbiologists, anthropologists, military brass, and diplomats. Thankfully they had set up\nan air conditioner to cool the place o\ufb00. We would review the tapes of the images later\nto \ufb01gure out just what the heptapods\u2019 \u201cgi\ueecb\u201d was. Our own \u201cgi\ueecb\u201d was a presentation\non the Lascaux cave paintings.\nWe all crowded around the heptapods\u2019 second screen, trying to glean some idea of\nthe images\u2019 content as they went by. \u201cPreliminary assessments?\u201d asked Colonel Weber.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a return,\u201d said Burghart. In a previous exchange, the heptapods had given\nus informations about ourselves that we had previously told them. This had infuriated\nthe State Department, but we had no reason to think of it as an insult: it probably\nindicated that trade value really didn\u2019t play a role in these exchanges. It didn\u2019t exclude\nthe possibility that the heptapods might yet o\ufb00er us a space drive, or cold fusion, or\nsome other wish-ful\ufb01lling miracle.\n\u201cThat looks like inorganic chemistry,\u201d said the nuclear physicist, pointing at an\nequation before the image was replaced.\nGary nodded. \u201cIt could be materials technology,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019re \ufb01nally getting somewhere,\u201d said Colonel Weber.\n\u201cI wanna see more animal pictures,\u201d I whispered, quietly so that only Gary could\nhear me, and pouted like a child. He smiled and poked me. Truthfully, I wished\nthe heptapods had given another xenobiology lecture, as they had on two previous\nexchanges; judging \ueecaom those, humans were more similar to the heptapods than any\nother species they\u2019d ever encountered. Or another lecture on heptapod history; those\nhad been \ufb01lled with apparent non-sequiturs, but were interesting nonetheless. I didn\u2019t\nwant the heptapods to give us new technology, because I didn\u2019t want to see what our\ngovernments might do with it."

Ask it what it means.\u201d\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think Raspberry\u2019s wearing a pager,\u201d I said.\nThe image of the room in the looking glass disappeared so abruptly that it took\na moment for my eyes to register what I was seeing instead: it was the other side of\nthe looking-glass tent. The looking glass had become completely transparent. The\nconversation around the playback screen fell silent.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d said Colonel Weber.\nGary walked up to the looking glass, and then around it to the other side. He\ntouched the rear surface with one hand; I could see the pale ovals where his \ufb01ngertips\nmade contact with the looking glass. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201cwe just saw a demonstration\nof transmutation at a distance.\u201d"
